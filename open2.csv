Jim_N,"Greetings enthusiasts!I hope you are all well. Iâ€™d like to follow up on the previous post, highlighting RTIâ€™s Admin Console. The console is great. You can view the entire DDS architecture, mesages types, topics, and data. However, sometimes you just need to see data scrolling on a terminal screen for good measure. This can be done with DDS Spy. Assuming youâ€™ve found the RTI Connext Launcher, which you should have explored the Admin console from, youâ€™ll want to select the Utilities tab near the top of the launcher.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/1/101eac26cab893870b7c7524f0c3c000c79b14ad.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/101eac26cab893870b7c7524f0c3c000c79b14ad"" title=""connxt_launcher1.png"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  alt=""connxt_launcher1"" width=""690"" height=""467""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">connxt_launcher1.png</span><span class=""informations"">950x643 50.5 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>Select DDS Spy.<img  alt=""ddsspy1"" width=""602"" height=""490"">Here, you can pick a domain, here the Trident works in 0, print samples, display idâ€™s, show handles, truncate names, subscribe to topics and filter via type or topic name. You can open as many of these as you like.Ok. So thereâ€™s an issue here. OpenROV has data partitions set up to match the reader/writers to individual ROVs. A partition allows readers and writers on the same domain to separate data streams. This is a good thing, however, DDS Spy, when using the GUI, does not have a clear partition selection process. I havenâ€™t figured it out yet. However, the command line works just fine.Navigate to your rti_connext directory. In the bin folder, you will find all the executable scripts (remember I am in Linux, so your windows applications may differ). Also, take a look at, <a href=""http://community.rti.com/rti-doc/510/ndds/doc/html/api_cpp/group__DDSNddsspyModule.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://community.rti.com/rti-doc/510/ndds/doc/html/api_cpp/group__DDSNddsspyModule.html</a>, the RTI Connext C++ API. This gives you all the commandline parameter for DDS Spy. You can also type ./rtidsspy -help.Ok, you need to match the partition, domainId, and select the topic or data type you would like to display.Try ./rtiddsspy -partition (enter you rov host name. this is found on the physical view in the admin console. it will look something like 4ecb6bâ€_ They are individual system names. You should see your host PC IP as well)Moving on:./rtiddsspy -partition 4ecb6b -topicRegex â€œ<em>depth</em>â€ù -printSampleYou should see something like:<br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/b/b00e71998ea39a36ccf8ed2684a4024e4aa46fc8.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/b00e71998ea39a36ccf8ed2684a4024e4aa46fc8"" title=""orov_ddsspy.png"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  alt=""orov_ddsspy"" width=""661"" height=""499""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">orov_ddsspy.png</span><span class=""informations"">804x608 52.6 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>Thereâ€™s good info here. We see the message sequence number, the topic name, rov_depth, the topic type, orov::Depth and pressure data, objectId and depth data.Good stuff. Play around with it, try different parameters and look at the topics. Once I figure out the trick to get the DDS Spy UI to match partitions, Iâ€™ll post the solution.Enjoy.In the next post, weâ€™ll take a look at, drum rollâ€_, how to read this data from a template c++ application, which I will post on github, soon. After which, we will discuss publishing data to the ROV.Jim",Jim_N,"Greetings enthusiasts!I figured out how to get the DDS Spy UI to monitor partitions. It was silly easy.Click the Advanced Settings tab in the UI and you will see a section labeled Partitions, comma separated.Merely enter the partition label in that text box and hit the run button on the UIâ€_yes, that easyâ€_I feel stupid.<img  alt=""ddsspy_advanced"" width=""640"" height=""480"">Moving on!<br>\nEnjoy,Jim",Jim_Trezzo,"Just attended the RTI Connext conference and learned a bit more about their product suite and licensing.  Good news is that extended availability is there for any researcher (any non-commercial developer) and can be requested from RTI (annual renewal license).  I can post more on this if folks are interested.Following up on Jim_Nâ€™s posts I did the following:<br>\nConfigure Trident to connect to local network (wi-fi)Brought up RTI admin console on my windows laptopAdmin console discovered Trident being on same wi-fi networkSelected system and topic within domain (trident-core)Selected DDS Entity â€“ rov_depthRight clicked, visualize &gt; sample logIn Data Type box, selected â€œshow data type detailsâ€ù button (to right of type name)Will show type tree. Select Equivalent IDL tab.Can now cut and paste idl to idl file. (ex. rov_depth.idl)Utilities can be used to convert type (xml &lt;&gt; idl)Also code generator will generate C++ code for publisher and subscriber from either the xml or idl files.I got a set of C++ files along with  USER_QOS_PROFILES.xmlalso on windows a file to set up a visual studio project.I compiled things (build) and was able to run rov_depth_publisher and rov_depth_subscriber.The problem I ran into is that I couldnâ€™t get the subscriber to listen to my Trident output.  There seems to be some way to associate the Trident and itâ€™s domain and partition with my subscriberI tried experimenting with the  USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml file to add that info:Did not work and I will try to find out how to actually do this.Jim T",webhoppery,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/jim_trezzo"">@Jim_Trezzo</a> In Admin Console, can you see the Trident dynamic data in the Topic Data panel? If you can, what Windows are you using? Home or Professional? Router model?If you canâ€™t see the Trident dynamic Topic data, can you see the dynamic data in the Shapes Demo?I couldnâ€™t see the Trident dynamic Topic data with Win10 Home and a Netgear N300 router. I ended up dual booting Ubuntu v18.04 with the RTI DDS Trial for Ubuntu v16.04. Seems to be working as advertised.Iâ€™d be interested in further info on the non-commercial developer annual license.Bill",Jim_N,"Thanks for exploring this <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/webhoppery"">@webhoppery</a> and <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/jim_trezzo"">@Jim_Trezzo</a>! As far as Windows useâ€_I havenâ€™t touched a windows machine by choice, other than as a dummy email terminal at work, for some time. Canâ€™t help you there. However, make sure you are partition matched, if not, you can see the topics but wonâ€™t be able to see the data.",Jim_N,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/jim_trezzo"">@Jim_Trezzo</a>, Howâ€™s the auto-generated code? I am pretty allergic to auto generated stuff, but curious as to what you have dove into.I think it would behoove the entire community to have a generic interface code base that wraps the more tenuous RTI DDS calls nicely such that a developer need not be a DDS expert in order to use. There are two generic DDS application projects that I know of, one from spiderkeys,<a href=""https://github.com/spiderkeys/SensorPublisher"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://github.com/spiderkeys/SensorPublisher</a>, and one I wrote for OCI OpenDDS, <a href=""https://github.com/binary42/OpenDDS_SkeletonNodeCpp"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://github.com/binary42/OpenDDS_SkeletonNodeCpp</a>. Both approaches need modification and testing.There is also ROS 2.0â€_but I havenâ€™t made the dive into that yetâ€_",webhoppery,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/jim_n"">@Jim_N</a> wrt generic interface code - the RTI Connector might provide a base.<br>\nRTI Launcher -&gt; Labs -&gt; RTI ConnectorThe interface code would be helpful for subscribing to existing Trident data, but what about payload data? Have you seen anything from OpenROV about payload interfaces and how the payload data passes through DDS? Or bypasses DDS - ie Python WebREPL? It seems like they canâ€™t change the Trident DDS code for every new user payload.What about presenting payload data on the Pilot display?Curious as to what Linux youâ€™re using? Iâ€™m having trouble getting the right compiler version to match what RTI built with.",Jim_N,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/webhoppery"">@webhoppery</a>Indeed, thank you.In regards to payloads, from past discussions, OpenROV is working towards this. I believe it will be DDS based. not sure about the pipeline. I am expecting information on this with in the next few months.Iâ€™m using Ubuntu 16.04. What compile issues are you having , exactly?Jim",Jim_Trezzo,"In reply to earlier messages,  I am looking at the code Jim N. shared as well as what RTI generates.  None of it is as approachable as I would like to see, but getting something to work is the first goal.  I have requested a â€œresearchâ€ù license from RTI for non-commercial use.  Will share how that goes.Also saw a connector to MATLAB/Simulink at the RTI conference and saw some interesting robotics and sensor fusion demos at a MathWorks conference yesterday.  This could be complementary or a bottom up alternative to ROS2 approach.  Need to get some of this integrated with Trident first!  Back to workâ€_Jim",Jim_Trezzo,"Just viewed the tutorial videos on the MathWorks DDS support package and wanted to share the link:  <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/rti-dds.html"">https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/rti-dds.html</a>If I can get this working with the Trident platform, it seems like a potent tool for software experimentation and development.Jim T.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tang191197,Hello !Iâ€™m working on a project for my degree on the openROV 2.8 DIY kit with the HD camera. I have a problem to add one or two external servo in order to control an external camera to make greaters pictures but I donâ€™t know at all how to make that. Thanks to my reading on the subject I know that there is auxiliary output to control external servo but I donâ€™t know how to control these outputs and what I have to change in the code or if i am supposed to make an pluggin to control it.If you can help me to solve this problem it would be great.<br>\nThanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Good timing!I had the RTI Connext DDS trial installed on a Win10 laptop.

The proper column heading names display correctly.

Donâ€™t give up!A google search for â€œunderwater photogrammetryâ€ù brings up a lot of useful results. There are commercial solutions out there but they are for stereo cameras. I didnâ€™t find anything that would work for the single camera Trident. Seems a lot of the software is for high budget projects (archeology, shipwreck reconstruction, etc.) using high end ROVs.The problem with underwater SLAM is lack of sensors. Thereâ€™s no GPS, no LIDAR. If a future version of Trident had dual cameras and some sort of sonar array, that would be great. Otherwise we are stuck with the single camera and maybe some dead reckoning based on telemetry data.I saw some article where they laid out easily recognizable metal plates with a checker pattern around the area of interest to make it easier to link the individual images more easily.Good luck",Jim_N,"Q1 A1: Yes. Free ware is VisualSfM, good tutorials on it at YouTube. A2: Arcsoft, and others exist, top quality but at a price.Q2 A1: Yes. A2: Not on the Trident at this time. High end ROVâ€™s, AUVs, and hybrids use Sonar/Doppler Velocity Logs for pose and mapping. Very expensive kits.The SfM that you did with the volcano you can do now with the Trident. Itâ€™s a high def camera so SfM will work. However, there are some caveats. You need to use the intrinsic camera parameters for best reconstruction, moving the Trident around can be tricky. Youâ€™ll want image overlap for feature matching. Turbid water will make it very difficult if not impossible. Iâ€™ve been trying it with Oyster reefs ther ein the Chesapeake. Iâ€™ll post more soon.ThanksJim",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will then shoot a couple of pictures of the Cradle installed in the front of the ROV Chassis.<br>\nRegards,<br>\nTCIII AVD<br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/3/3ad7cbbbe205e368134a64f90763d69e0e1e2a34.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3ad7cbbbe205e368134a64f90763d69e0e1e2a34"" title=""Cradle Front View without Bar.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Cradle Front View without Bar.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">4000x3000 1.92 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/f/fbf08f03c3e690cdcb74d3e7bf81bc84102f2cfc.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/fbf08f03c3e690cdcb74d3e7bf81bc84102f2cfc"" title=""Cradle Front View 2.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Cradle Front View 2.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">4000x3000 1.65 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/c/c95ff4651fb6102fc7ec1bcff2efa3b3293dca96.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/c95ff4651fb6102fc7ec1bcff2efa3b3293dca96"" title=""Cradle Top View.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Cradle Top View.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">4000x3000 1.43 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/6/63a05b024c47b723983ccffdc65689520189c170.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/63a05b024c47b723983ccffdc65689520189c170"" title=""WTC in Cradle 1.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">WTC in Cradle 1.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">4000x3000 1.7 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/a/a920a0487f0e6779dbf390da36c63784337088f6.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/a920a0487f0e6779dbf390da36c63784337088f6"" title=""WTC_Cradle Side View.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">WTC_Cradle Side View.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">4000x3000 1.71 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>",TCIII,"I completed the installation of the WTC Cradle into the front of the ROV Chassis and relocated one of the transverse rods that was interfering with the bottom of the Cradle.<br>\nRegards,<br>\nTCIII AVD<br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/3/3c3ca78769e9595cc6ca10c19ade92536d8e60e9.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3c3ca78769e9595cc6ca10c19ade92536d8e60e9"" title=""Mounted Cradle 1.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Mounted Cradle 1.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">4000x3000 2.19 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/f/f059907b810b4245167165a84cb947d171d3d0a1.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/f059907b810b4245167165a84cb947d171d3d0a1"" title=""Cradle with WTC 1.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Cradle with WTC 1.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">4000x3000 2.1 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/f/f5cca0dc84628414d96edc63d7fd662ee1b8ba96.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/f5cca0dc84628414d96edc63d7fd662ee1b8ba96"" title=""Cradle with WTC 2.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Cradle with WTC 2.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">4000x3000 2.06 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>",Brian_Grau,Great pictures!

Eric_Stackpole,"I wanted to start posting little tidbits about development weâ€™re doing on Trident on the forums, and I realized that a quick set of tests I did recently to see what size of payloads we can fly with would be a great start.Alright- I had some fun with this.At first, I attached just an empty GoPro case (mostly filled with water to make it neutrally buoyant - Iâ€™ll use an actual GoPro with supplemental flotation later) to the bottom of the ROV as shown.  To my delight, Trident handled it very well, and I could hardly notice a difference in performance.  This was all at night which makes it harder to notice subtle details, but Iâ€™d say the only noticeable difference is that the pitch was a bit off, but that was easily correctable by adding a slight amount of vertical stick- almost none at all.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/e/e089c411f65fba1df027a669757a685066a63858.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/e089c411f65fba1df027a669757a685066a63858"" title=""20151208_193835.jpg""><img  width=""690"" height=""388""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">20151208_193835.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">3264x1836 1.56 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>Since that went so well, I figured â€œah heck- letâ€™s put something bigger onâ€ù so I hot glued on a plastic box I found (which would also be flooded) and took that for a test drive.  Okay- well, this configuration didnâ€™t work so well.  If I were flying very slowly I could just about make it across the length of the 20â€™ pool without hitting the bottom or the surface, but for the most part it pitched up (yes, up) like crazy once any speed was added.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/d/dabef2798cb3b12fcab16484e9375582d1713a7a.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/dabef2798cb3b12fcab16484e9375582d1713a7a"" title=""20151208_192239.jpg""><img  width=""690"" height=""388""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">20151208_192239.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">3264x1836 1.5 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>At this point I was on a roll, so I rummaged around for other stuff around the lab to glue on the ROV and found a Pelican 1010 case. I attached this case roughly where the GoPro was and let it flood.  Despite the noticeably larger size, this test also went very well.  I was certainly able to notice that the ROV was more pitch sensitive (I couldnâ€™t decide if it wanted to pitch up or down) but I was able to control it pretty well on the stick.  At low speeds I didnâ€™t even need to use the stick very much and the whole thing flew pretty gracefully in straight lines.  When I turned, I noticed a lot more roll than before.  Anything but slow turns will be a bit sloppy, but still very doable.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/4/4f33a4aba642387451b6e8dab8e47e4420d5a143.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/4f33a4aba642387451b6e8dab8e47e4420d5a143"" title=""20151208_195316.jpg""><img  width=""690"" height=""388""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">20151208_195316.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">3264x1836 1.62 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>Finally, I decided to try an idea I had been thinking about for a while which was to mount the big box (which has the dimensions of 185 x 120 x 45mm) to the back of Trident, behind the fins.  I used some scrap acrylic and a bunch of duct tape to do this.  This is the test that really got me excited- Trident flew beautifully!  As I suppose one might expect, it turned a little slower than usual but certainly it was fast enough - maybe it would take 1.5 seconds to turn 90 degrees.  Where it really shined was the tracking during forward flight.  I guess this is also intuitive, but having the drag behind the vehicle and aligned with its CG along that axis caused it to fly like an arrow.  I could point it to a part of the pool (both in heading and pitch), and by only pushing on the forward joystick it would go straight there.   I envision that for larger payloads such as side scan electronics, fancy scientific sensors, acoustic positioning transducers, etc, there could be a bracket that screws into the bottom and runs straight back for things like this to mount on.  I donâ€™t see any reason payloads couldnâ€™t even be comically large compared to the vehicle- itâ€™s got plenty of power and the performance falls off pretty gracefully.   I half considered taking an empty Trident shell and and taping it onto the operational prototype backward just to see what would happen, but then I realized I was very hungry for dinner and that the FroYo place up the street was about to close.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/2/21480b724dad4ece45f3836105139a086aa1778e.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/21480b724dad4ece45f3836105139a086aa1778e"" title=""20151208_201154.jpg""><img  width=""690"" height=""388""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">20151208_201154.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">3264x1836 1.58 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>I plan to do more precise testing once we have dynamically accurate prototypes ready (this prototype has a different CG and slightly different geometry than what weâ€™ll ultimately have) but I am feeling pretty good about attaching stuff to Trident and and doing transects.   Especially if we can add some hydrodynamic cowling, it seems that even fairly large items can get strapped onto the bottom without major issues.",Scott_W,"Hi EricFirst off thanks for sharing this, <img  title="":beers:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":beers:""> it great to hear feedback of how the system is going<br>\nIt also raises a couple of questions.To add versatility to mounting - [I know you have talked about the potential for mount spots (I assume some sort of threaded â€œnutâ€ù in the injection housing)] have you considered designing into the injection housing some sort of standard V or T slotted makers beam system to allow things to be added? rather than gaffer tapping on a bit (yes I know it was just a trial and great to see the quick and dirty results)Also if the Trident is going to be capable of using wifi to communicate with external payloads, the wifi would typically only travels through 100-150mm of water so the location of the â€œaerialâ€ù will be important  or an eternal plug where the payload could be connected toInterested to hear your thoughts<br>\nScott",Eric_Stackpole,"Hey Scott- thanks for the encouragement!Youâ€™re correct that the mounting concept weâ€™ve been working with is to include periodically spaced threaded inserts (basically embedded nuts) in the bottom of the vehicle. With this system, a slotted rail could be added after the fact, but would not be built in.   Youâ€™re also right that using double sided tape was just for quick and dirty prototyping- I would not suggest using such things with an expensive payload in the field!Weâ€™re still working on what the exact spec will be for the size and separation of these holes.  My guess is that it will end up being something like M3 holes spaced 50mm apart in either direction.As for the WiFi comms, the 10cm or so of water that we can transmit through shouldnâ€™t be a problem as I expect payloads to be mounted against the side of the vehicle. Since WiFi travels just fine through plastic and air, one can think of any non-water (i.e. plastic) material between the ROV and the payload like a tunnel for radio waves.  For now, I want to keep the electrical power for payloads separate from the ROVâ€™s power system to reduce risk, so payloads should have their own power source.  I expect that the main payload people will fly with initially will be GoPro cameras.Also, at a holiday party the other night we decided to get really carried away and attached two very large water-filled tubes (actually toy crayon-shaped piggy banks someone got at a dollar store) to either side of the the ROV with duct tape.  These have as much (perhaps more??) mass as the entire vehicle itself and are equivalent in size to pretty serious side scan transducers with electronics.  As it turns out, the vehicle flew pretty darn well with them too!  Trident has plenty of power, so as long as itâ€™s drag is balanced, it seems to have quite a bit of payload capacity while maintaining speed and stability!<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/7/79d72817a419e8be8cdf6a6ecb4b9411d2a24495.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/79d72817a419e8be8cdf6a6ecb4b9411d2a24495"" title=""20151210_203741.jpg""><img  width=""690"" height=""388""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">20151210_203741.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">3264x1836 1.57 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>Anyway, thanks again for the questions- keep them coming!~E",Scott_W,"Hi EricThanks for the replyJust a thought if you are going to use M3 (although M4 is a more â€œstandardâ€ù size in engineering) are they going to be using Long/Coupling Nuts so that you get greater thread engagement so you donâ€™t rely on just 4 threads to hold on to those precious payloadsAlso you may need something at the base of the nut so someone overzealous doesnâ€™t screw a bolt in so hard that it punches through the plastic body below the nutAs for spacingâ€™s maybe a couple specifically set up to take GoPro mounts (as you indicate the most likely basic payload) mmmm maybe down facing by 2 and front facing at the top by 2<img  width=""180"" height=""180"">PS I like how you are trialling the new missile launch payload option <img  title="":smiling_imp:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":smiling_imp:"">at a holiday party the other night<br>\n&lt;img src=""/uploads/openrov/original/2X/7/79d72817a419e8be8cdf6a6ecb4b9411d2a24495.jpg width=â€œ180â€ù height=â€œ180â€ù&gt;",Eric_Stackpole,"Scott- Thanks for the advise.

The video settings are related to how fast the topside computer can decode the video. If we get more feedback from users that persistent changes would be helpful here, we are open to changing this.It checks for firmware version match at the start of each boot. If the version matches (which as long as you have not made firmware changes it should) then it should not do an upload. Are you seeing it do the check or the full upload?Thank you for the feedback on this issue. We will see if we can re-create this in the lab. We do not use the Logitech F710 wireless (which if I remember correctly is what you are using) and will see if this issue shows up on the F310 and the PS4.The motor settings are in the â€œsettingsâ€ù applet.

I have been hoping to set up the triggers to control the AUX servo that controls my water sampling bottles.",rune_soldal,"Hi Brian,Have done some more testing, and tested more specific on each issue. Some solved, some new turned up. Iâ€™ll feed you with a lot here, so better give you my setup details first:OpenRov 2.8, sn. 2549, with HD camera upgrade.<br>\nLaptop: Lenovo X240, Win10 64 bit, Intel i5 4210U 1,7gHz - 2,39gHz, 4gb ram, SSD disk.<br>\nChrome, Versjon 55.0.2883.87 m<br>\nLogitech F710 wireless Gamepad.<br>\nWlan between tether and laptop, but using ethernet cable now when testing.<br>\nImage as you mentioned is the latest (I think), OpenROV_31.0.0_Devbuild-2016-12-06<br>\n2 external LED lamps mounted. Otherwise in original condition.The setup is the same as I used with the old camera and old software, witch worked flawless. Well, more or less at least.First, I wanâ€™t to clarify the points we already discussed, have tested further on these:1 - Geomux. On my computer, with some testing, I had to reduce bitrate to 3mbit to avoid lag. Could not notice any different in picture quality by doing this, but seems to work quite stable with this. I figured out that the changes in Geomux went back to default when I close the browser tab, and reopened it. Changes stays if I just refresh the tab, and also stays if I reboot the ROV. Would prefer that these changes was saved, so I didnâ€™t have to do these tweaks every time.2 - Firmware update. Reason that I tought it updated every time, is that every time I power up the ROV, it comes a new message in the â€œmessage-bubleâ€ù, saying â€œFirmware update appliedâ€ù. So after playing around with the ROV a couple of hours, I got a whole list of those messages in the â€œbubbleâ€ù.3 - Trigger-happy gamepad. After I did my previous tests, I realized my chrome was not updated to the latest update. So I updated it to the latest version (version nr. mentioned above), and the gamepad worked as it should. Only changes I did between these 2 tests, was the chrome update, so assume this was the reason. So guess if anyone else complains about â€œtrigger-happyâ€ù gamepads, they should check the browser update first.4 - Reversing motors. Yes, it can be reversed in the setting, but that applies for the motor in all situations. Meaning I with this can get it to turn the correct left/right, but then it will go backwards when it should go foreward. This was ok with old sw, so I assume something has been turned around here?5 - For now I have set right trigger to power level 2, and left to power lever 5, since itâ€™s these 2 levels I mostly use. But to be able to increase and decrease step by step, like with the lights, would be perfect.6 - There is no assignment for start/stop video recording in the input tab. Only for recording telemetry data. Well, Iâ€™m not able to find it at least.Puhâ€_okâ€_and now the continuing, with new issues I came across:7 - After powering up, itâ€™s almost every time missing camera picture. Most of the times itâ€™s enough to refresh the tab to get the picture, but one time tonight I had to reboot the ROV to get the picture. The cockpit comes up ok.8 - When I change from Gyro to Compass, Iâ€™m not able to turn back to Gyro. Tried many times tonight, and only one time was I able to turn it back to Gyro. Refreshing tab doesnâ€™t help, had to reboot ROV to get back to compass.9 - When recording with the inbulit feature, the video doesnâ€™t show on the playback. The cockpit data is OK. Tried several times. Camera window black in new_ui, and white in mobile_ui.10 - I had som issues with camera-tilt not working, either with keyboard or gamepad. Checked the wiring, seemed to be ok. Suddenly it worked OK, and was working after. Donâ€™t know what did it. Just mentioning it, donâ€™t put any effort in it, Iâ€™ll let you know if it is becoming a returning problem.11 - Tested some recording with Screencastify. Worked perfect, both in new_ui, and mobile_ui. But after recording the menu/settings buttons did not work anymore (both uiâ€™s). The buttons was working again after refreshing the tab. Tried several times, and was the same issue every time.12 - Heads-up display. This is just a wish from my side. I would prefer the possibility to have the heads-up display in the middle of the screen, like on the old software. Can this be made as an optional add-on?Guess that was all for tonight <img  title="":wink:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":wink:""> Still this is only after testing it on my dining table, havnâ€™t dived with the new version yet. And please, donâ€™t misunderstand me, this is not meant as critic or complaining. The new camera and software is awesome! Just want it perfect as soon as possibleâ€_ Please let me know if you need me to test anything. My ROV is diving-ready, and I have the sea close by here, so I can do dive-tests as well if you need me to.Rune",rune_soldal,"Just got a little confused about the DEV versions here nowâ€_ The version badevguru was mentioning in this thread, says version 2016-12-07 in the link, but the filename says 2016-12-06, witch is what I installed.

This time itâ€™s one specific issue, not a long listâ€_guess that is a relief?First to explain some expressions, to shorten the text a bit:<br>\nStartup screen: meaning the fancy screen telling you â€œconnecting to ROVâ€ù, with some wise words below.<br>\nWiFi: meaning laptop connected to internet with wifi, at the same time the ROV is connected with LAN cable.<br>\nData: meaning the gyro, depth, batt voltage, and the possibility to get options with the menu button. (This is followingâ€_if I donâ€™t get data, it comes up with a blank box when pressing the menu button on top left). These tests is don with mobile_UI)So here is my sequence:Running wifi, using DHCP, using the <a href=""http://rov.openrov.net"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">rov.openrov.net</a> address: Startup screen OK, Data OK, video picture OK.<br>\nWithout wifi, using DHCP, using the <a href=""http://rov.openrov.net"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">rov.openrov.net</a> address: Startup screen OK, no data, no picture.<br>\nWithout wifi, using static IP address, using <a href=""http://rov.openrov.net"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">rov.openrov.net</a> adress: Startup screen OK, data OK, no picture.<br>\nWithout wifi, using IP address AND static IP address: Startup screen OK, data OK, no picture.<br>\nWITH wifi, using IP address and static IP address: data OK, no picture.<br>\nWith wifi, using IP address, aut. static IP address: data OK, no picture.<br>\nWith wifi, using DHCP, using <a href=""http://rov.openrov.net"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">rov.openrov.net</a>: everything OK again, with picture.Bottom line: Iâ€™ve tested this a lot, rebooting, refreshing again, again and again. And seems like I have to have the laptop connected online at the same time it is connected to ROV, to get video picture (and using the <a href=""http://rov.openrov.net"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">rov.openrov.net</a> address). For me, thatâ€™s bad news. Iâ€™m using wifi from ROV to laptop (meaning I canâ€™t be online on the same time), and maybe most importantâ€_you canâ€™t rely on online connection in the field.If you have problems to replicate my problems with your setup, Iâ€™ll be happy to let you play with my system using ex.

Imaginex used to make a cheaper model but Iâ€™m not sure if they still do.The cheapest sonar solution Iâ€™ve found is the Humminbird 360 scan with an appropriate sonar display.  Total cost is around $2300USD.  Unlike the Lawrence unit, the Humminbird 360 uses a servo motor to automatically scan sectors or an entire 360 degree circle, much like a Blueview Sonar ( <a href=""http://www.blueview.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.blueview.com/</a> ).

It requires input from a manually operated heading sensor slaved to the sonar transducer.  If the transducer (and heading sensor) arenâ€™t moved, nothing will appear on the sonar display.One other option worth considering might be to use â€œDown Scanning Sonarâ€ù which both Lowrance and Humminbird offer.  This sonar takes a vertical slice of the area ahead, below and behind.  In its normal orientation it might offer a look at what the bottom beneath the ROV looks like.

jmorgan,"Hi everyone, Iâ€™m assembling an OpenROV 2.8 as part of the Aquarius Project, which is a search for a Meteorite that fell into Lake Michigan in February of 2017. The ROV will be used to survey the Meteorite strewn field ahead of a sled which will be used to retrieve the fragments. Recently Iâ€™ve had some issues connecting the ROV to my laptop. Iâ€™ve also posted this on OpenROV Answers, so Iâ€™ll say what I said over there.<br>\nCurrently near the end of the ROV assembly, but when it came time to turn connect the ROV to a computer for the first time to see if everything works, I am unable to connect to Cockpit. When I connect the ROV to my laptop, it initially powers on, but I am unable to connect to it. The Power light lights up Green, the Homeplug Connect and Ethernet Connect lights light up orange, and the ROV lights up and makes a series of beeps. But before long, the homeplug light goes out, the ROV headlights begin periodically flashing, and at no point am I able to access cockpit . When I attempt to ping the ROV at 192.168.254.1, it always times out. Additionally, when I unplug the USB from the Laptop, a number of the lights on the ROV stay on. Also ran a windows diagnostic to test the connection to 192.168.254.1:8080 and it gave the response: â€œYour computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource (192.168.254.1) is not respondingâ€ù I have raised a support ticket, but I figured it wouldnâ€™t hurt to post over here in case someone else experienced the same issue and found a solution.",TCIII,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/jmorgan"">@jmorgan</a>,I assume that you have configured the IP address of your laptop to be 192.168.254.2 or something other than 1?Did you burn your own SD card with the Cockpit software, buy it from OROV or did it come with your OROV2.8 kit?The OROV headlights periodically flashing means that the Cockpit software is not sensing a connection with your laptop.Are the blue leds on the BBB strobing back and forth indicating that the BBB has gone through the boot-up process?Regards,<br>\nTCIII AVD",jmorgan,"Yes, Iâ€™ve made sure my IP address is different to the ROV, I burned my own SD Card with the Cockpit software, and the blue lights on the BBB were strobing back and forth.",TCIII,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/jmorgan"">@jmorgan</a>,Then this sounds like a communication failure between the two Tenda modules or an issue with the topside Interface Board since the OROV headlight LEDs are flashing periodically.In normal operation, after the Controller Board has booted up, the green LED should be solid, the center orange LED (Homeplug Connect) on the topside Interface Board should be blinking indicating that it is communicating with the Controller Board and the orange Ethernet Connect LED should be solid.You might try a continuity check on the tether pair to ensure that you have continuity on both wires.Regards,<br>\nTCIII AVD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will then pot the exposed solder pads with epoxy to waterproof them.The M100 motors weigh 225 grams more than the original DST-700 motors so the stern of the Frame is going to try to roll back about the center of mass.

I really had to use a joystick to get proportional control of the motors as just blipping the keyboard motor direction controls resulted in poor directional control.When moving in reverse I found that the thrust from the two horizontal M100 motors would cause the ROV to try and sink unless I was very judicious with the reverse motor speed. This is because the thrust from the horizontal motors was being deflected upwards through the two holes in the top of the chassis by the back of the Camera/Electronic Control WTC.All in all I think that this is a very worthwhile modification if you are planning on building an OROV2,8 from the bottom up. To try and modify a completed OROV2.8 might be difficult as drilling the necessary holes for the vertical motor mount and the horizontal motor mounts might be very difficult on a completed chassis.Regards,<br>\nTCIII AVD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cebrock106,"Hi, I have a scratch-built OpenROV that I started a couple of years ago - itâ€™s based on OpenROV 2.4. I made the decision to use the Raspberry Pi instead of BeagleBone because back then there wasnâ€™t a low-cost BeagleBone available. I combined the Pi with an Arduino Uno connected to the ESCâ€™s. I managed to make the software work on the Raspberry Pi Model B, and itâ€™s been working great, but recently I had to redo the endcap system so I took the opportunity to replace my old Model B with a brand new Raspberry Pi 2 Model B+.The problem arises with getting the new software to work. Iâ€™m having to start from scratch due to the new CPU on the Pi 2, but for some reason Iâ€™m not able to get it to work. Hereâ€™s what I have done so far (this is, as far as I can remember, exactly the same process I followed when I did this on the Model B two years ago):So it runs fine, no error messages, but when I log in to the pi in my browser, all I get is a black screen. What gives? While the browser is loading, the ssh terminal gives me a whole bunch of â€œGET â€_ blah blah.htmlâ€ù messages, which makes it look like itâ€™s working, but still no activity on the browser. I can also log in to port 8090 and see the camera output, which looks great.I am thinking it may have something to do with the fact that my Arduino software is horribly outdated, but when I try to verify the OpenROV Arduino software in the Arduino IDE, a whole bunch of errors pop up. All I want is the bare-bones Arduino sketch for motor control only, and I canâ€™t figure out how to do that.It did give me an error at first - â€œwaiting for Arduino capability response before sending commandâ€ù or something, so I bypassed that in the code. No doubt something the new Arduino software has - it didnâ€™t change the black screen, though.I would appreciate any help from anybody who knows more about this than I do. Also, it would be really great if some support was offered on github for Raspberry Pi - perhaps an official OpenROV on Raspberry Pi image?Thanks,Collin",Niels,"Collin, I do not have an answer to your question, but what camera do you use? I use the raspi cam for the video but compression is a bit poor. I am watching your post, since I am interested to make this work for model2 too. At the moment I control the raspi with a joystick, control with pygame. Could be a temporary work around ;). Good luck.",cebrock106,"Neils: Thanks for replying to my post!<br>\nMy camera is just a cheap old HP webcam. It was working fine before the hardware upgrade. I do have another brand new webcam I could experiment with though.<br>\nAs far as controlling with pygame goes, it sounds intriguing- perhaps you could send your software layout so I could experiment?I have also been partially successful in getting the older version of the software to run on Pi2 but mjpg-streamer refuses to run inside node.js; I get â€œInit.VideoIn failedâ€ù or something.",badevguru,"I can also log in to port 8090 and see the camera output, which looks great.That is good news.  All the browser does is load that same video stream.  So whatever the issue is, it is the code in the browser doing something funky.

But it is really ugly copy paste work: I warn you. I have no idea if it will make any sense to you. You will have to modify the script to your setup, since I control the ESC directly with the PWM of the pi (with a resistor in between). The driver I use is called pi-blaster. What I did: An USB joystick (Microsoft Sidewinder) sends axis and button data to the laptop with pygame. The data is translated into motor speeds and piblaster values and send via UDP to the raspberry. On the raspberry I listen on the port for the comma separated commands. If there is more than 0.5 seconds lag, the commands are purged and the buffer emptied. It executes the commands 4 times per second and turns lights on/off and controls the ESC-s. Top buttons control the tilt of the cam and the vertical thrusters. The vertical speed is controlled by a lever on the base. There are some bugs at the moment: after midnight the heartbeat stops the ROV (donâ€™t play too late, it actually happened to me in my shed), if the wire is cut the ROV simply continues.

The <em>Lumens</em> have a solder jumper inside that, if connected, will enable the same direct control of the lights with the same signal. However, when controlled like that there will be no automatic temperature control, so I would still recommend controlling with a servo-style PWM signal if possible.-Rusty",arnaregilsson,Thanks for your answer.So there should be no problems using those lights on 2.8,Rustom_Jehangir,The only other thing to consider is the weight.

felipeadachi,"Hi there!My name is Felipe Adachi, and Iâ€™m making a Masterâ€™s project with the ROV V2.8 as a subject of research. Iâ€™m researching Fault Detection and Diagnostics on the ROV.To do that, Iâ€™m using the data obtained from the telemetry, by using the â€œrecordâ€ù option from the cockpit. Iâ€™m currently using data gathered from my own ROV, but it would be great to have data from other ROVâ€™s beside mine! So Iâ€™d like to ask if there is anyone that would be able and willing to help me, by sharing some data from their own ROVâ€™s, be it the V2.x series, the Trident (if/when available), or any other ROV.Iâ€™m interested specifically on the .json files that are generated when you use the option of recording telemetry data from the cockpit: all those data that appears on the right-side of the cockpit: â€œhdgdâ€ù, â€œdeapâ€ù, â€œpitcâ€ù, â€œrollâ€ù, â€œyawâ€ù, and so on. Additionally, it would be helpful if I knew information of each recording session: if the dive was: <strong>(a)</strong> On moving waters (ocean, river, etc.) or still waters (lake, pool, etc.), <strong>(b)</strong> If the ROV was â€œhealthyâ€ù-no faults, <strong>Â©</strong> If the ROV had some fault from the start and <strong>(d)</strong> If the ROV presented a fault during the dive (e.g propeller, sensor, leakage, battery fault).Even if I had partial information, or just the .json file, I am sure I could make use of it too!Thank you all for the consideration!Best,Felipe Adachi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
balder.matt,I am thinking about setting up a solar charging capability for my Trident on my sailboat. Does anyone have a recommendation on the number of watt panel I would need to charge a Trident in about 3-4hrs if it was fully discharged? Assuming  the panel has full sun. Would having a deep cell battery and inverter be part of the system? Love to hear your thoughts!,pforperry,"Me tooâ€_I have just posted a reply on the Solar/Power Bank Charging thread.This seems like a natural progression for Trident and from a technical point of view I can see no reason that would prevent Trident from being charged from solar panels and a deep cycle battery.I have not yet calculated minimum or maximum charge rates (are there any experts out there?) however considering typical system losses, I plan to use an existing 250w panel running through a 15A regulator to supply a nominal 100w dc-dc battery charger to comfortably achieve a safe and reliable charge rate.This is based on a system I am testing for a related project (<a href=""http://www.master-instruments.com.au/products/63158/CH-TSB003PCBR5.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">dc-dc charger</a> and <a href=""http://www.master-instruments.com.au/products/63842/LICB-18650-3S4P-HC-R.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">battery pack</a>).   Considering the need to boost from occasional low voltage inputs I would expect this 100w charger to provide a minimum 50w of charge without stressing out.

BBB connected via adapter acts like a server who receive your socket. The Arduino based kit 2.8 controls devicees like LEDs, motors, servos directly. After BBB get the socket it will make command to Arduino directly, then Arduino get the command and make some reaction.The client (your browser) would talk to BBB first by socket. You can made it by writing a script (Python, for instance) or just pressing the keyboard as suggested in Cockpit ( 192.168.254.1:8080). The browser would send some sockets to itself, so some sockets like â€œrovpilot.toggleLasersâ€ù you send to the BBB would not work. Only the socket send with format like â€œdeps.rov.on()â€ù work.Then BBB would write some command as C language to kit 2.8 board, which can be read by Arduino.If you want to add some new features for OPENROV, I think you should both modify the js codes (plugins) and Arduino codes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our tether was actually broken up into two sections, the â€œfree tetherâ€ù was the normal ROV tether, while the â€œROV tetherâ€ù was replaced with speaker wire with a clump weight attached between the â€œfree tetherâ€ù and the â€œROV tetherâ€ù. This was done because we found that with a clump weight attached to the normal ROV tether it had a tenancy to try to untwist itself.Personally, Iâ€™m not sure if you really need a separate clump weight rope. You should be able to mount the clump weight on the same tether as the ROV if you do it correctly. But, give it a shot, this should all be relatively easy to setup and test. Also donâ€™t forget to post your results and the forums or put your expedition on <a href=""http://OpenExplorer.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">OpenExplorer.com</a>, thatâ€™s what this community is really all about.<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/walt_holm"">@Walt_Holm</a> could provide more details on this subject, since he actually designed the clump weight system that we used on the ROV. Iâ€™m just paraphrasing what I know about this system, secondhand.",Walt_Holm,"Hi Zac:I use a clump weight on the tether any time Iâ€™m operating deeper than 50m or so.  Weâ€™ve taken experimental versions of OpenROV down to 280m in Lake Tahoe, and it wouldnâ€™t work at all without some form of clump weight.As Patrick said, you can basically skip the â€œclump weight ropeâ€ù that is shown on your diagram, and attach the weight (~1-2 pounds) directly on the tether.  Iâ€™ve been evolving the design over time, and the last iteration of the design seemed to work pretty well.  The downline was made of speaker wire, in this case 24AWG rather than the 26AWG tether provided by the kit.  The heavier wire is stronger, and can better carry the load of the clump weight.  Speaker wire wonâ€™t try to untwist when you put the load of the clump weight on it.From the clump weight, run 15-30m of neutrally-buoyant tether (you can find it in our store) to the ROV.  Where the clump weight mounts, attach a small strobe light to aid in orientation at depth.At some point Iâ€™ll post something more complete, with pictures, but this should give you an idea.-W",zacmacc,"Interesting, thanks for your responses. I think the diagram I posted was meant for heavier, deeper setups where  the tether is not appropriate to hold tension, it definitely makes sense to do it the way you guys have suggested, itâ€™s much simpler. 280m? wow thatâ€™s very deep.

Accuracy also is dependent upon water temperature, layers of different water temperature currents, and quality of water (fresh, salt, and particulate content/creatures as well as pollution attenuation). GPS locations are accurate to a around 7 feet and are only available above water. You will be within 330 feet of the GPS position at all times with your OpenRov.

michail,"I am new to this issue.  I want to build a hybrid  ROV which would be bigger than the Open ROV (about 6 - 8 kg and with 6 motors).I have searched for low kv motors, and it seems that the one used by Open ROV (DST-700) are the best choice in terms of price and power. From what I understand on Open ROV they run with the standard prop(60 mm x 32 mm pitch) on 9 V and 7 A at full power which gives about  6300 RPM and 60 W. The speed of water projected should be about 32 mm * 6300/60 m/s or 3,3 m/s.I plan to run them on 3S 12 V Lipo or Liion batteries and to run them to at least 120 W (I am sure that with water cooling they can handle even much higher power). That would give about 7700 RPM and 12 A.One of the biggest issues is to find adecuate propellers. I could not find bigger props than the 60 mm. with small pitch and LH RH versions.I have seen that DIY props cut from bronze are not too complicated to produce. So I am thinking of going this route.The Prop Parameters:<br>\nI want to have the same maximum vehicle speed and therefore same water jet speed expelled from prop, i.e. 3.3 m/s. That means that the pitch should be (7700/60)/3.3 = 26 mm.I want to go with two blades instead of three blades, for the sake of fabrication simplicity. I assume that in order to match the three blade version power, I need to increase the prop â€œwash areaâ€ù by 50%. Furthermore, I want to increase the total power by 100 %. That means that the original prop area of 28 cm  (30 mm radius2 *3,141) should be now 28 * 1,50 * 2 = 84 cm. However, since it will run on 7700 instead of 6300 RPM, a reduction of this area by  (6300/7700) * (6300/7700) = 0,67 is required. Therefore, the final prop area should be 84 cm * 0,67 = 56 cm2 or a prop with a diameter of 84 mm.So I assume that a 84 mm diameter by 26 mm pitch prop will work well with DST-700 motors at 12 V power and current of 12 A.Can someone confirm if my calculation is roughly correct  and whether this is really a good idea to do bronce props oneself?  I really cannot think of where they can be obtained.",Walt_Holm,"Hi <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/michail"">@michail</a>:Good luck on your project to make a custom prop!  Weâ€™d love to hear how things manage to work out for you.There are a couple of misconceptions in your original post.  The Kv rating of the motor refers to its unloaded speed (or, more correctly I believe, the voltage it generates when being driven as a generator), but the motor is not being run in an unloaded condition.  While I donâ€™t have the data in front of me now, I believe the props turn at somewhere around 4000 rpm when running at full power in a bollard-pull condition (the vehicle is not moving).  I believe 7A is about the correct current draw.If you donâ€™t have the software tools to model the motor and the propeller, you might want to just set up a test tank using something like an aquarium and just experimentally run the motor with different props.  You might find that the current motor  and prop at 12V is actually pretty close to what you want to achieve.-W",michail,"Actually, you are right, Kv rating is for no load condition, usually, the revolutions under load (for air at least) are about -10 -20 % less. I am very surprised that OpenRov runs on 4000 revolutions. Could it be that the original props are not really adecuate?Luckily, it should not really change the logic of my calculations (or so I hope), because I am using relative values. Basically, by increasing voltage from 9 to 12 volts one should decrease the pitch by  9/12 to get the same water speed.

Now, Iâ€™d like to turn your attention towards PTMs and how, in my opinion, they can assist the marine archaeological and possible search/rescue groups in identification of submerged objects via polynomial texture maps (<a href=""http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/ptm/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">PTM</a>).Quoted from the link:""Polynomial Texture Maps (PTMs) are a simple representation for images of functions instead of just images of color values. In an conventional image, each pixel contains static red, green, blue values. In a PTM, each pixel contains a simple function that specifies the red, green, blue, values of that pixel as a function of two independent parameters, lu and lv.Typically, PTMs are used for displaying the appearance of an object under varying lighting direction, and lu,lv specify the direction of a point light source. However, other applications are possible, such as controlling focus of a scene. PTMs can be used as light-dependent texture maps for 3D rendering, but typically are just viewed as â€˜adjustable imagesâ€™.""It may not be obvious at this moment what being able to modify light source and refocusing objects in a given image might illuminate for you. However, given the examples from HPs website and the papers written by Tom Malzbender, highlighting Sumerian, Egyptian, and ancient Greek discoveries made by using a PTM rig as an analysis tool, one may begin to consider what such techniques could do for underwater explorers like ourselves.Well, as I sit here, 12am on a Friday morning, wrapping up the CTD work and getting ready for some wet testing of the near finished kit, I find myself planning the next payload project.

rey_reza,"Hello.Just wanted to introduce myself to you guys. My name is Rey and I will be working at OpenROV until the end of this year. I am a Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, Canada, and originally from Indonesia. I am actually taking a year off of school because I think what we do here at OpenROV is very interesting, and would be a great experience for me. I truly believe the vision of OpenROV - from underwater exploration to the magic school bus (if you know what Iâ€™m talking about) - and just love the fact that the team here is really passionate of what they do. So for me, it was a really easy and simple decision to take a year off of school and join OpenROV. I am relatively a simple guy. Other than work, I read books, play guitar, and sing.I am currently working on the external payload for the Trident. The idea is to develop a generic payload for the Trident so that we can add sensors, lights, etc. to the Trident and the payload should be controllable using WiFi. This is an interesting concept because as some people might already knew, WiFi signal does not travel far underwater. However, after doing some preliminary test, we found that WiFi signal can travel for a very short distance underwater (about 2-3 inches). The reception should be even better when the surface that holds WiFi module and Trident are touching. So, if we attach this external payload at the bottom of Trident, we should be able to make them communicate with each other. Right now the candidates for the WiFi module that will be used are ESP8266 and Particle P1 (similar to Particle Photon that is based on P0).There are three main parts of this project: software (and firmware), electronics, and mechanical.<strong>What I have so far:</strong>Software + Firmware:Electronics:<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/6/6b8ea6f0b6be300024a7b84e99a6793a099a4368.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/6b8ea6f0b6be300024a7b84e99a6793a099a4368"" title=""Capture.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""673"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Capture.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">1061x788 252 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>Mechanical:<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/d/d377894b57c5636409d6e6ce0a78bdbebfbd3429.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/d377894b57c5636409d6e6ce0a78bdbebfbd3429"" title=""20160613_214423.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""690"" height=""388""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">20160613_214423.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">4160x2340 2.21 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>Other than this project, I am also interested in computer vision stuffs, as I spent 8 months at Flex (formerly Flextronics) working on image processing algorithm and optics for automotive.I am very excited to hear any ideas/inputs on this project, especially on how to make this accessible to the user.

In terms of what we do.At the moment we are hoping to get get the Trident we pre ordered in Nov / Dec this year and then learn to drive it as it comes out of the box.First project with students will be a â€œcomparison of methodsâ€ù on a local field camp in Feb 2017 where they do a survey of a seagrass area by hand (tapes, quadrats, handheld cameras), and then do the same area by ROV (with a simple, down facing GoPro).  Then they write up results and look at the proâ€™s and conâ€™s of both methods.  Its a good way to get them, as users, to start thinking about how to collect data and that leads to thinking about what else that can do with ROVâ€™s depending on specific projects.Since its an ROV, we can actually let the students drive it.  There is a lot of interest in UAVâ€™s here as well, but we run into legal and regulatory issues as they fly and have the potential to crash into members of the public, so we have to have people qualified to fly them that cuts out undergrads out of much of the hands-on involvement in data collection. <img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:"">Also, a lot of the people who our students will be looking for employment with after graduation (consultants, Govt Departments who do monitoring and scientific work) are moving towards using ROVâ€™s for the â€œgruntâ€ù type survey work they need done as there are far less Occupational Health and Safety issues than with having divers in the water, and productivity benefits.  We think you can get more transects done in a day with ROVâ€™s than with divers.Upshot is that we can use affordable ROVâ€™s like Trident, with simple payloads like a GoPro to update our teaching units and give the students some practical â€œjob readyâ€ù training with an emerging tech.We are also hoping to use ROVâ€™s in some of our interactions with local High Schools where we do â€œlook at us, we are great and you want to enrol here for Uniâ€ù type recruitment activities.  <img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:"">There is a lot of interest from researchers.  Monitoring Seagrass rehab projects, Artificial Reef deployment and evolution, Fish population studies, Coral Reef survey and monitoring (especially in areas with lots of tourist pressure).To some extent at the moment its a â€œbuild it and they will comeâ€ù thing for us, but we see a lot of potential.  We will know more once we have had a Trident for a little while and assessed how robust, reliable, and â€œHonours Student Proofâ€ù  they are as against ongoing cost of ownership.In terms of the more technical, hardware aspects that seem to be you focus, I have passed on a link to this thread to the academic in know in Engineering and IT here.  Heâ€™s the one pulling together the group that is interested in payloads, sensors, programming, apps, and i am hoping he will take an interest in what you are doing with the WiFi stuff. The beauty of the open source community thing is that everybody can leverage off everyone elseâ€™s contributions to some extent and progress their own projects better and faster that way.If you are interested, have a look at these two links.  They will give you a look at the kind of environments we will be looking to use ROVâ€™s in and the sorts of things we have had the students do to date.  The second link is probably more relevant to the UAV stuff Lars does, but weâ€™ll see where they go.<a href=""http://www.murdoch.edu.au/Future-students/International-students/Study-abroad-and-exchange/Choosing-what-to-study/Summer-program/"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.murdoch.edu.au/Future-students/International-students/Study-abroad-and-exchange/Choosing-what-to-study/Summer-program/</a><a href=""http://mucru.org/"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://mucru.org/</a>Seeyahs!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because that is what the available  connector had.I do recommend using some oil or grease with whichever connector people use. I use oil because in my minds playthrough of what happens when water gets in, the oil is less thick and so is pushed into the connector and fills the space between the oring and the pins, keeping water from reaching them. The grease will do a better job of keeping water out, but (I imagine) would maybe not fall back against the enemy as well. <img  title="":smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":smile:"">The second link, though I wouldnâ€™t use it for the tether, looks like a really great way to make a seal for any connector.

My experience is that if you use a 4 wire economy wiring UTP cable (=2 pairs)  and solder connectors to it, the bare soldered ends create a lot of noice (=donâ€™t work for long distances). Remember I donâ€™t use the Tenda adaptor at this point yet (waiting on mail), the lines are really used as patch cable directly between the laptop and the raspberry in my case. I saw your tether cam is nearby the ROV, my cable is 100m long: thatâ€™s the difference.I will use little grease for the connector, since oil might pollute the swimmingpool I am testing mine in :).<br>\nFirst test run of my ROV in a lake nearby:<br>\n<div class=""lazyYT"" data-youtube-id=""iA7CniB1pVE"" data-youtube-title=""Raspberry Pi Submarine ROV (underwater drone)"" data-width=""480"" data-height=""270"" data-parameters=""feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque""></div>",Stefan,"Hey Niels,I like your design very much - I guess those are PVC pipes from a hardware store?Currently Iâ€™m working on my own design, using a Raspberry Pi 2.

Used the Pi connected to a monitor/mouse/keyboard just long enough to connect to my wifi (getting the SSID and password saved into the system).  It is easier if you can get your router to consistently give the Pi the same IP-address.  Also used raspi-config to enable SSH, and disconnect SERIAL from the console but leaving it enabled. (This lets me connect an arduino on /dev/ttyS0).Now I do all my work using Putty over SSH connected via the WiFiThere is no problem connecting Chrome (yes, it was not happy with Firefox).

I knew this housing worked well down to 300â€™ and my plan was to convert it into a towable fish I could drag behind my boat. I liked the housing but had no way to control it, other than the tether. I was working on a fin design for the housing when I became involved in the<a> Search for Clarence Holmes.</a>After my first trip to Laurel River Lake, I knew we needed more than a drop cam so I started thinking about how I could build a compact, robust ROV that we could move in and around the forest of trees we needed to explore. Ideally a unit with no tether would be best but that is way too far out of the budget so I began thinking about â€œflyingâ€ù the drop cam and Rover 1 started to take shape.

Rather than a 1 pound single weight which was actually 2 oz too heavy, I screwed some fishing weights<br>\nonto the motor mounting ring. By leaving the mounting ring a friction fit on the body, I can slide it toward the nose or tail to get the trim right where I need it.

newport95ca,"Hi All,I would like to use the six auxiliary wires on the OpenROV v2.8 (that is the two purple PWM, one white open wire, and three white striped servo wires) in ways that are different than they are currently wired. I have been digging through the documentation and schematics for a couple days now and I am not sure how to go about doing this or if it is possible. Electronics is a big interest of mine but isnâ€™t exactly my strong suit just yet.What I would like to do is connect three sensors (each requiring 5v, GND, and an analog read) and a thermocouple to the mega. Is this possible to either us the existing connections or to rewire and reroute connections on the board? Help much appreciated.",Jim_Scholz,What do you need for the thermocouple? I think you will tie up 5 wires with the sensors. Unless you can use the 5V+ or ground for the thermocouple I think you will be a wire short.,newport95ca,"I believe I can use the ground wire for the thermocouple, but can look into that. Do you know how I can go about modifying the wires to be four analog reads, one 5v and one GND though? I canâ€™t find any useful, straightforward information in the documentation besides the wiring schematic, which is honestly a little over my head.",Jim_Scholz,"I think your best bet would be to open a ticket with support. They can tell you right off the bat  how to get 5V on the purple wires and if you can convert the whites with tracers to analog leads. Either way, I believe you will have to do physical changes to the main board.",Walt_Holm,"Hi <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/newport95ca"">@newport95ca</a>:If you look at the schematic for Controller Board 2.8, the information on the six auxiliary wires is mostly on Sheet 2, with a little more on Sheet 6.The six auxiliary wires are attached to pins 20 through 25 on the main wire harness connector (a DB-25 connector).  From there they go to six test points, labelled TP20 through TP25.  If you hold the board in your hand with the DB-25 connector on your left, the test points are on the lower left side of the board.Things are made more complicated by the fact that 5 of the 6 pins are pre-wired to attach external lights and an external servo.  But the user has the opportunity to undo this pre-wiring, by removing resistors R70-R72 (located on Sheet 2), and R73 and R74 (located on Sheet 6).  These resistors are located under the motor speed controllers (ESCs) that are soldered onto the board, so it will take a little finesse with the soldering iron to get at them.  You can see a photo of where some of the resistors are in <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/controller-board-modification-for-2-pairs-of-light-cubes/4375"">this forum thread</a>.So wires TP24 and TP25 are already pre-wired to +5V and ground, so you might want to leave those wires as-is.  The +5V supply comes from the ESC BECs, and if this is not suitable for your needs you might want to remove resistor R71 and instead wire TP24 to one of the main +5V supply pins on the prototyping headers of the controller board.  The other four test points- TP20 to TP23- can be made available for your use by removing R70, R73, and R74.  After removing those jumpers, you can now run wires from TP20-TP23 to analog inputs on the microcontroller chip (Atmega 2560).  There are spare analog inputs on prototyping header J4 - see Sheet 2 of the schematic for details.Since you donâ€™t say what your sensors are, I canâ€™t judge whether the analog inputs on the Atmega 2560 are suitable for your application.   If you really are trying to hook up a thermocouple, it will likely require some sort of amplifier/cold junction compensation before it can be routed to the A/D converters on the microcontroller.If youâ€™ve never done this kind of work before, this may all seem very complex and confusing.  Take some time to study the schematics and carefully plan out what youâ€™re going to do before attacking the board with a soldering iron.  Then make sure you check your work carefully before applying power to the revised controller board.",Jim_Scholz,Walt_Holm you are an ACE with a â€œCâ€ù!  Thanks for answering this one.

sayan.719,"i am an electronics and communication engineering student from India, I was thinking of making an underwater drone, heard of this community from an online source.so the thing that i want is a complete wireless way to control my drone, there should not be any wired connection between the drone and the base station.thus it would be really helpful if you guys could assist me on this issue, I mean what are the kind of wireless modules that can be implemented underwater  ? keeping in mind a reasonable size and cost.",Brendan,"Hi Sayan,There isnâ€™t really any way I know of to achieve wireless ROV control underwater for a reasonable size and cost. Using a tether is a much better solution in terms of cost, bandwidth and range. Why does your ROV need to be wireless? And how deep do you intend to dive?Radio modules wonâ€™t penetrate water to a significant depth unless youâ€™re using a extremely low frequency (3-300Hz), which would in turn require a very long antenna (up to 60km for communication with submarines). VLF (3-30kHz) will only work up to about 20m depth. The data rates are extremely low at these frequencies. Higher frequencies will only travel a few cm in water.For greater depth and range a better option than radio is to use an acoustic modem, but they are usually over $2000 each. You would need one on the ROV and one on the surface for control. The data rates are much too low to stream video (100bps - 9000bps).Another option is to use a tether from the ROV to a surface buoy and radio from the buoy to your base station. But this will be affected by surface winds and conditions, if there is any surface spray it could drastically reduce the wireless range. It will also effect the handling of your ROV. But it might be a good compromise for what youâ€™re trying to do, if using a tether to your base station isnâ€™t an option.Cheers,<br>\nBrendan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to this I have been trialling a couple of different camera systems looking more from cost effectiveness point of view if I want say 4or 6 or 8 camerasIn short my needs are pretty simple the best image quality I can get (subject to realistic $â€™s) camera suitable for taking a Time Lapse Photos @ 0.5, 1 seconds Intervals to generate the SfM models, a wide Field of Vision to get good coverage of the site suitable to at least 60m of water (happy to push the 45m units to the greater depth) and takes good images under low light conditionsThis weekend just passed I used a camera rig with 2 cameras spaced 1.2m apart with a GoPro Hero 4 Silver (16MP FOV 122Ë_ vertical say $US400) and a Xiaomi Yi sports camera (16MP similar Vert FOV say $US90 with housing). I had wanted to do some comparisons stuff but we had pretty good vis on the wreck so I just swam the rear half of the wreck.In short I am disappointed with the Xiaomi performance but not writing it off quite yet. Basically it has near same performance as the GoPro specs (16MP stills @ 0.5 images/second etc etc) and on the surface all of the images I have done with it look fine and no different to the GoPro.But during the dive I was capturing a still every second but in the lower light all of the images were pretty much black whilst the GoPro images ran fine (see side by side performance bellow) The Xiaomi Yi sports camera was (I think) using stock standard settings so I may have to tweak a low light setting before I write it off.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/6/6f04d3905836629e90e6bbf16c126f31173af53c.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/6f04d3905836629e90e6bbf16c126f31173af53c"" title=""Image comprarison compressed.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""656"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Image comprarison compressed.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">1240x945 786 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>I know I can add lights (and most likely will) and it will help things (and bring out more colours) but I was hoping that they may not be too needed in short term till I have settled on camera configurations (and number of cameras) given say a requirement of say 80 Lux (equivalent amount of light in a darker warehouse) and the FOV of the GoPro <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux</a> per camera and assuming the FOV of the OpenROV External Light Cube is equivalent to the GoProâ€™s FOV (XX Brian do you know the FOV for the light cube?)) and knowing I typically produce SfM say 2 to 4m off the bottom<img  width=""511"" height=""167"">Anyway  the semi worked results from the GoPro are bellow (I still have to clean up a few mesh points to get a better image -there are WAY TOO many fish causing issues with false heights) but here is the 1st cut out of the software as it stands<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/8/8ce95fb97c1dc208ce3935a19cb02a79679ab8e7.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/8ce95fb97c1dc208ce3935a19cb02a79679ab8e7"" title=""Tuggerah take 2 resize.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""690"" height=""464""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Tuggerah take 2 resize.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">1920x1292 1.07 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>PS the wreck is the SS Tuggerah in 46m you can see more details of the vessel and site <a href=""http://www.michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=75"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">here</a>In short anyone got any good options given $\",Brian_Grau,This is looking incredible.

Although it doesnâ€™t support RealVu 3D (3D multibeam) it supports â€œLiveVu-Forwardâ€ù and â€œFrontVuâ€ù.Lastly, as some may recall that one of the things I first learned about the Garmin system  was that the transducer and display communicate via an Ethernet clone they call â€œGarmin Marine Networkâ€ù.  To see if any of the components might be recognized by my computer network I connected both the PS31 transducer and GPSmap 741 to a router.  The router immediately connected with the 741 but not the transducer.Iâ€™m still working on how best to integrate the transducer and ethernet comms into my ROV.  Iâ€™ve got a couple ideas but nothing that Iâ€™m particularly happy with.

thomash,"Dear readers,I would like to introduce the project I have just started to work on with two fellow students. In short, we are three MSc-students from the Delft University of Technology and we aim to make the (our ;-)) OpenROV fully autonomous (meaning: autonomous behaviour, cutting the wire).This will be done, most likely, by implementing ROS loaded with an autonomous controller on the Beaglebone and control the OpenROV from there, bypassing the cockpit-interface all together. From what I read so far, this has not yet been achieved and I have not found any other projects that are currently working on this. But if I am wrong, I would like to hear that, so we can focus our work on extending someone elseâ€™s.Anyhow, I would love to hear your thoughts on this project, any at all, from technical realisations to general opinions. I will try to update the status of the project regularly.Cheers,Thomas",Fe3C,"Welcome to OpenROV!Your plan is a great idea! I am not aware of anything finished in this direction. Maybe because usually the OpenROV is used in a lot of different ways and environments so that it is very hard to create the overall autonomous software.The autonomous software is on my list too, and I agree that a ROS implementation would be the first step to go. Especially as there are so many ready to go modules available. However, I have faced many problems due to the high diversity under water. It is very hard to gather enough reliable data of the ROVs environment to implement a control software. I would love to hear more from your approach!Have you already started your built?",thomash,"Our OpenROV is already up and running, we did some dives in a â€œsmallâ€ù towing tank at the university and once in the open water - and the OpenROV did not break <img  title="":slightly_smiling:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slightly_smiling:"">.For the moment we decided to limit the application to mellow circumstances (probably the towing tank) because the focus of the research is more on a proof of concept for some communication and object finding principles than that it is for proper interaction with a real environment (although, it will become of interest in the long run eventually).The idea thatâ€™s in my mind right now is to completely ignoring the current node.js and <a href=""http://socket.IO"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">socket.IO</a> environments and rewrite basic functionalities in C++; implement ROS - and some of its nifty features, and start adding simple autonomous routine tasks.",e4andy,A very adventurous project!

But as I mentioned earlier, weâ€™re going to start with relatively safe environments and do some experiments. Donâ€™t expect any autonomous action from me in the open water anyday soon!So far II have not been able to give the project a lot of time in the past few days, at the moment I am (trying) to install ROS on the BeagleBone. At first I tried to install it directly over the OpenROV-software, but since it has so many (weird) network configurations (no internet unless cockpit-page is loaded for instance) I ran into a lot of errors, so  I just flashed a brand new Wheezy image on it.Cheers for the positive reactions so far, I will keep you guys updated if I have anything to show.",blptrsen,"Interesting thought, but what is the project? Did I miss that somewhere? That will determine the complexity of the autonomous routine.",thomash,"The project, for now, is to implement a simple autonomous routine on the OpenROV.So far the idea is to actually only use the OpenROV for its hardware platform and actually â€œrewriteâ€ù (just a bit, as I donâ€™t need an interface or manual control for now) most of the javascript stuff on the beagelbone and replace with a ROS-based C++ state-machine. At first, Iâ€™m not planning on changing anything on the controller, but maybe in the long run.A question for now: Iâ€™m having a hard time finding the code where the actually command is <strong>sent</strong> to the microcontroller?I can see that the press of the appropriate key issues a command from <strong>rovpilot.js</strong>, but in which file can I see the code where it actually passes on the command through the serial-bus to the microcontroller?<strong>edit</strong>: Does the OpenROV do anything like <a href=""http://tenderlovemaking.com/2014/01/19/enabling-ttyo1-on-beaglebone.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">this</a> to enable serial communication?<strong>edit2</strong>: Also, are there any checks on that the microcontroller runs before taking commands from the beaglebone, like sending a test message back in forth in order to make sure both units are active? Suppose if I donâ€™t run any of the OpenROV software on the beaglebone and just emulate a command to the microcontroller (through UART /dev/ttyO1 as defined in config.js), would it simply accept it?

The succes of the later completely depends on how well I can get the OpenROV to control itself.One of the hickups thusfar, is that I plan to do vision-recognition, which will have to be processed on a more powerful unit then the beaglebone. For now Iâ€™ll probably use the ethernet cable to do the processing on the surface and send acquired information back down under water.So far: I started with a completely fresh image of Ubuntu 14.04, installed ROS, initialised UART1 (P9_26\t P9_24)  , made a list a essential commands I wish to execute (thruster settings, direction, etc) and soon will start to write the first ROS-nodes which will emulate these commands and send them to the microcontroller.About communication between the BeagelBone and the Arduino around boot time, I found some references to boot-checks (I think), but I havenâ€™t taken a lot of time to study it more thorough.That was it so far!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eric_Stackpole,"So Iâ€™ve been trying to figure out a good way to keep an ROV stationed around a given location without requiring active station keeping (such as with a boat controlled by an attentive captain or some sort of dynamic positioning system).<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/7/b/7bba4020b63ffc1636797d3c9c7dbab1571bb4df.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/7bba4020b63ffc1636797d3c9c7dbab1571bb4df"" title=""11036699_10104112281616578_8079572963785005008_n.jpg""><img  width=""375"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">11036699_10104112281616578_8079572963785005008_n.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">720x960 76.3 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div> The general problem is that with any kind of wind or water current, a vessel on the surface (which presumably the ROV is attached to) will get pushed away from where the ROV was initially deployed, and even if the ROV itself has the ability to fight that current, the vessel it is attached to will eventually tug it away.  Vehicles (manned or unmanned) that have to actively stay above a site are necessarily complex, so any way to keep an ROV on station passively is likely to be easier to implement, more robust and lower cost.My thought has been that a simple way to keep station would be to employ a sort of clump weight that would sit on the bottom and would be heavy enough to stay put but light enough to be transported to a site easily.  Presuming that the ROV would be examining things on the bottom, the tether would have to go this distance anyway, and the tether could be made thicker and stronger along this length since that portion would not need to be pulled by the ROV.  This clump weight could be as simple as a hunk of metal that a tether goes through, or as advanced as a lander that houses multiple ROVs (similar to the one I drew in <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/thinking-like-a-kid/1492"">this post</a> several years ago)Of course, a drifting boat on the surface would still be likely to drag the weight, so instead, a cable running up from the weight could go to a floating radio buoy that is not big enough to drag the clump weight. If the buoy could be made to relay a wireless signal to a the shore or a nearby boat (which would no longer have to keep station precisely), I believe this system would allow ROV operations to happen with much less effort- especially in rough seas.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/b/f/bf0efc53c7f1f8859e691b8fd416f151d2154378.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/bf0efc53c7f1f8859e691b8fd416f151d2154378"" title=""Lander Bouy.png""><img  width=""419"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Lander Bouy.png</span><span class=""informations"">1620x1932 27 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div> Some means for isolating the movement of the buoy from the clump weight would be needed to remove impulsive vertical loading from surge which could snap the tether and also to remove lateral loading which could cause the clump weight to drag).  To address this, a float that is suspended from the tether several meters below the surface (which I call a â€œload stabilizerâ€ù) could be added to the system.-----How it works----As you can see from the photo at the top of this post, weâ€™ve already built a prototype of this system which we tested briefly at Lake Tahoe a few weeks ago.  Obviously a beautiful day on the lake is not exactly the rough conditions this system is designed to handle, but itâ€™s a start.  I thought Iâ€™d post a little bit more about how the system worksâ€_Although the system could be made to work with simple WiFi, we chose to use a long range â€œEthernet Bridgeâ€ù system that is capable of communicating high bandwidth signals over several kilometers.  We chose to use the RocketM5 system by Ubiquiti.  For the buoy, we used an omni directional antenna, and on shore we used a 90 degree â€œsectorâ€ù antenna.  Hereâ€™s a list of our BOM for the radio system which ended up costing around $500 total.1 RocketM5-USA 802.11N MIMO 5 GHz Rocket AP US<br>\n2 AMO-5G10 5GHz AirMax Dual Omni, 10dBi<br>\n3 RocketM5-USA 802.11N MIMO 5 GHz Rocket AP US<br>\n4 AM-5G20-90 90 Degree 5GHz MIMO 20dBi w/cablesThis system works great (you can see us using an earlier non-buoy-based setup with these radios <a href=""https://openexplorer.com/expedition/findingkennettca"">here</a>).  Effectively, using a set of these radios is like having a REALLY long Ethernet cable stretched between your two points of operation. The signal that goes in on one end comes out on the other. This is called a â€œbridgeâ€ù mode, which worked great for us but there are many other configuration options to choose from if thatâ€™s your thing.  The radios are powered with POE (Power Over Ethernet) and come with a wall-pluggable POE injector.  On the boat (or buoy) side, where wall power is not available, we just got a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NTTHLRO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"">12v POE injector</a> from Amazon and powered it using a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00935L44E/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"">USB/12v battery power supply</a>.Iâ€™ve attached a functional diagram below which I (of course) drew with MSPaint and am quite proud of.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/8/3/83d57b82902e96c9435c12930f9646cd7507eb4d.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/83d57b82902e96c9435c12930f9646cd7507eb4d"" title=""Ethernet Bridge Bouy Diagram Thing.png""><img  width=""690"" height=""342""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Ethernet Bridge Bouy Diagram Thing.png</span><span class=""informations"">1172x581 32.1 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div> One thing to note is that we chose to use hollow walled pipe instead of normal SCH-40 PVC because the weight of solid PVC was significantly greater.  The pipe has a 4"" outer diameter.   Also, we ended up having the tether come out of the top of the buoy to make the electronics more reparable and reduce leaking risk.Finally, not shown in this diagram is an additional 1"" OD PVC pipe equal in length to the buoy that was made to dangle below the buoy an additional meter and a half or so with a few kg of weights on the end.  This helped keep the buoy stable and guided the tether downward.

There is still a lot of work and testing to do.  We must find ways to make the buoy sit more vertically, we want to try using a load stabilizer, and we want to test the system in rough seas.  Once thatâ€™s done we may also want to add features such as a GPS module so the buoy can report where it is, a flashing beacon that makes the buoy easier to find, and perhaps optimize the buoy to be more easily deployed.All of this is a work in progress, but I thought it would be good to post where weâ€™re at and get some feedback.Special shout out to <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/users/erika_bergman/activity"">Erika Bergman</a> (shown below) who did most of the building for this prototype and was out with the buoy during our test deployments.

No real science, but from a fair bit of trial and error, the units that have tended to float most up right and get the â€œmost out of the waterâ€ù are at about a 3 to 1 ratio (2 units out of the water 1 in the water). Additionally the heavier the weight at the bottom the better for standing the unit up (we normally core out a 250-300mm foam float to act as a sleeve to add buoyancy at the interface).  Equally, just cut a hole in a bucket and fill it with space filling foam. Do not underestimate windage. Can most of the electronics be condensed down to the base (say 200m pipe) with then a 25mm linkage up to the antenna??. But, again more and then some more weight at the lowest base point.I would also advise some form of anchor and some chain rather than just weight, it will hold better with less overall weight. We often use a 1.5kg folding anchor with less than 1m of lightweight chain and then some 3mm cord and it will hold fast a fairly decent buoyed system in some real current (but the narrow diameter of the cord makes it a little harder to pull up on the hands)I wouldnâ€™t go with a sub surface buoy to adsorb shock (I would on a moored boat) but we just use a reasonable large surface float. I would suggest that the equipment is just clipped to a tether (say 3-4m) back to that float (we again just use heavy duty game fishing trace and clips [say 400lb gear] but you will need a couple of swivels)Scott",Jim_N,"Fantastic! Man do I wish I could have been there to see it work. Great progress towards opening up the use space.

In one of our brainstorming sessions, I brought it up with Walt and Eric as an alternate to having a support vessel maintain position. As you can see, they went with it! Now that the concept and equipment works, Iâ€™m going to try and mount a new communications mast to my boat and try this out in the ocean. I already have to deploy a buoy anyway to mark a shipwreck, this is just the next step.Some other things I thought I would mention from my observations:I was very impressed with the speed and range. We were able to conduct full operations with the ROV from about 1-2km on shore, take that feed and upload it to the internet. We almost had someone remotely driving from the internet too! This is the only system I know of that is capable of such telepresence.Although the battery looks small, it was able to power the buoy for the entire day (6-8 hours) without having to swap out for a new one.In addition to the GPS module Eric wants to add, I made the recommendation to add in a way to remotely turn on/off the buoy/ROV combo. Anyone who has operated an OpenROV knows that reboots are sometimes necessary for whatever reason.Weâ€™re going to have to figure out what to do with the tether. Having a down-line to the anchor and a tether going down together is just inviting an entanglement situation. Ericâ€™s â€œlanderâ€ù approach solves a lot of the issues, but it will require a cage with a tether management system operating at depth. I donâ€™t have a solution for that right now.",Darcy_Paulin,"You could use something like a Ethernet cable as the line. It is in no way ideal, but it is strong enough to start with and it will give you opportunity to see what you actually need from the cable/anchor line. Ethernet cable is cheap.You could also thread a tether down a braided rope. I suspect braiding through a larger (than the 1/4 which i used) rope would be much much easier.I am putting a buoy in Howe Sound tomorrow (no rov tether) so I have been considering this problem.",vladarkhipov60,"Hi Eric &amp; Brian,<br>\nIâ€™m glad to watch a progress with the OpenROV idea.

Core out the center of it and it should provide the stability required. Iâ€™m not sure how wide to make it though.<br>\n<img  width=""220"" height=""294"">",jackey_15,"HiI think your project sounds amazing. I am currently working with similar project but I am using WiFi instead. There is a problem I am struggling. I donâ€™t know how to p2p connect 2 device together. Do you know anything about it? That would help me a lot.Many thanks,<br>\nJackey",hunigraphics,"Wow!<br>\nIdeas come in quick. My 1st thought looking at V1 design is that it would be great on a flat bottom but if you had reef? you would have a nightmare of tangled tether line. Having the tether from the surface down to the bottom leaves the majority of the tether mid water &amp; free from entanglement. Also with the surface Buoy would it be possible to weight it with replaceable batteries that could feed the trident if desired or if batteries in Trident were flat? As we cant replace the batteries in the Trident this would expand it operational time &amp; also allow to put a much bigger capacity power supply to feed Trident &amp; also manouver or stabilize the Buoy.If I was using my boat out on the water I wouldnt need a surface buoy because I would use my autopilot anchor lock feature on my MotorGuide Xi5 Electric motor to keep me still in current. One vertical shaft that rotates with a single propeller &amp; stays in position with GPS. With the remote control I can one click to move it 5Ft at a time in any direction. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85LpqahGXvw&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85LpqahGXvw&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><br>\nNow this is a overkill obviously for a surface drone but it has simplistic concepts that is already working in the real world &amp; it is use to keep my 18Ft boat stable in high currents not a small buoy lolIt seems to me that locking it to the bottom means you are already in a boat to move its location, but I thought if you are remote to the surface buoy then you would need to be able to control it &amp; move it. Using GPS to keep something in position is also done on tiny quadcopters and are cheap as chips. Using already designed technology means youre not reinventing the wheel &amp; its the size of you thumb.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/e/ee03a1d7be507c162710ccf2b4455f59902242c1.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/ee03a1d7be507c162710ccf2b4455f59902242c1"" title=""12242247_878052192291234_2046787347_n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""500"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">12242247_878052192291234_2046787347_n.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">960x960 88.6 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>Just thought I would share my thoughts to try help in the brain stormingCheers<br>\nMark",TCIII,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/eric_stackpole"">@Eric_Stackpole</a>,<br>\nAll of the M5 datasheets indicate that the M5 runs on 24 vdc @ 1 amp yet you are running the M5 on 12 vdc.<br>\nPlease explain.<br>\nRegards,<br>\nTCIII AVD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NIW,"I am building an ROV with one raspberry pi on the ROV and one on the surface. I need them to communicate over an at least 100m distance. I am currently using MQTT to send messages between them over an Ethernet cable. I have run into many issues using this method. What other ways are there for tether communication over 100m, that is fast enough for motor control and can work with the raspberry pi using python?",Jose,"Hi,According to your description, your main concern is speed, which comes from the latency inherent to your Ethernet cable length, and any overhead generated in the messaging system (MQTT in your case), and the GUI-&gt;Message + Message-&gt;BB/ControlBoard-&gt;Motor natural processing time. It will be necessary to measure or estimate each one to identify your bottleneck, because you may run into a situation where the logical/transport layer for your communication interface is not the problem, thus changing it wonâ€™t provide you with any benefit.I have 2 x 100mts tethers, and we expect to run some dry tests into a couple of weeks. Perhaps we can measure some round-trip delay in the full communication interface. Yet, Iâ€™m sure there are other users who have already done this, itâ€™s just a matter of searching in the forum if they have reported some results of their tests.PS: A quick one, is the latency value displayed in HUD.Regards,<br>\nJ.

Sanjay,"I think that the new Oculus Rift VR headset display, which seems to be taking the gaming world by storm, could also be a useful way to pilot Remotely Operated Vehicles. It would be great to see this type of consumer technology making its way into OpenROV, because it could pave the way for greater things. Today an ROV submersible, but tomorrow aerial drones, or robot spacecraft, and even lunar rovers. There seems to be such a frenzy of creative activity going on with Oculus Rift in regards to developing new gaming experiences, that it would be a shame to neglect the possible uses for tele-presence, which has many important practical applications.What kind of camera setup would be best for capturing a more fully encompassing visual field necessary for immersive tele-presence?",David_Lang,"re exactly right. We talk about this a lot around the office. Colin has an Oculus dev kit. <br><br>The camera setup will be key. Eric had some ideas on that. What do you think?"")",Sanjay,"m assuming that it should be a twin-camera setup for stereoscopic vision. Since the lenses inside the Oculus provide a fish-eye effect, this would have to be accounted for thru the camera lenses or else via some post-processing of the video signal.Another thing is that the Rift provides additional immersion by having the head-tracking sensors whose feedback are used to influence the rendered video output. In a remote camera telepresence scenario, it might also be nice to have some way for your natural head motion to similarly be reflected in what you",Sanjay,"MEMS might also potentially be useful for camera panning/tilting with minimal latency, in response to the head-tracking sensor feedback:<a rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2013/03/04/are-mems-based-smartphone-cameras-the-next-big-thing/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2013/03/04/are-mems-bas...</a>The technology may not be there yet, but this is the kind of thing where if you could convince people there was a future market for it, they might work on developing the tech.

Weâ€™ve had students in the past use the mag data on land rovers to map local effects (field effects) in buildings rather effectively. Localized fields tend to mask the Earthâ€™s field. The Earthâ€™s field is actually somewhat weak. Something like 60 microtesla. Thatâ€™s why you want you magnetometers as far away from any EMI in your system as possible, otherwise you mask out the Earthâ€™s field. The MEMS mags are not ideal, but it would be an interesting experiment on the ROV, nonetheless. (non-ferrous materials are invisible). But please correct me if I am wrong.I do agree with the coil solution for detecting metals in general, active system as it were, as the Mag is passive and only gives you static/dynamic field reading and can not induce them.Anyway, best way forward is to pick up a metal detector from a local yard sale, and slap it on the ROV. <img  title="":smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":smile:""> Iâ€™m rather surprised someone hasnâ€™t done this yetâ€_",Kevin_K,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/jim_n"">@Jim_N</a> I would have no problem installing a large metal detector on my MSOC ROV.

That sounds like a very interesting project indeed. So you need the model for your autopilot controller? I am also doing a PhD at the moment. It is regarding the effect of underwater currents on underwater Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). Part of my program will entail using a 3D dynamic simulation of the OpenROV in order to study the effect of currents. By the sounds of it, this would be equally valuable to you. Perhaps you could develop your autopilot on the simulation before implementing it in real life. In addition it seems like there are other areas of cross relevance, for example, you will need image processing in order to carry out the optical positioning, and I for my SLAM, so we can share knowledge regarding this aspect too. So it seems like a lot of overlap and Iâ€™d definitely be interested in collaborating in any way.For the CFD characterisation Iâ€™m using StarCCM+, Iâ€™ve already created the simulation and am now trying to get to grips with the method to actually obtain the coefficients.â€“ Regarding the thruster model I can recommend a relatively simple and straight forward one, if you refer to the paper â€˜The Influence of Thruster Dynamics on Underwater Vehicle Behavior and Their Incorporation Into Control System Designâ€™ by Yoerger et al. 1990.<br>\n<img  width=""316"" height=""85"">So if you know the torque of the motor, through the first differential equation you can model the thruster speed. Then with the thruster speed you can work out the thrust.

The pins can be found here:<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/e/e6b93a34eabb27d4ebe5fc75351009ca3040936e.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/e6b93a34eabb27d4ebe5fc75351009ca3040936e"" title=""j12pins.png"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""690"" height=""473""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">j12pins.png</span><span class=""informations"">779x535 744 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>####2. Attach the Beaglebone BlackAttach the Beaglebone Blackâ€™s P9 header row on the controller boardâ€™s header pins so that the ethernet port faces away from the ESCs/DB-25 Connector, as shown in the picture below.<strong>Note:</strong> Failure to install the Beaglebone correctly (like if you have it reversed) can cause irreparable damage to the Beaglebone!<img  width=""564"" height=""240"">The pinout for the DB-25 header cable is shown in the image below:<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/6/632c2b2f99b209d1a042b28e7e12e0c8dad705cb.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/632c2b2f99b209d1a042b28e7e12e0c8dad705cb"" title=""pinout.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">pinout.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">1432x1074 202 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>While optional, I found it highly convenient for development purposes to break the header cable out to a prototyping breadboard so that I could easily access pins and test devices. Here is a picture of my breadboard setup:<img  width=""347"" height=""171"">Take note of how I broke out the 12V (PORT BATTERY +), 5V (TETHER_A), and 3.3V (3V3) power buses so that I had easy access on the breadboard.You have a few different options for powering your board. For my dev rig, I use a 12V/2A wall power supply. I wire the 12V output to the prototyping board and wire it up to the DB25 cables as shown in the following picture:<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/4/467a0418ba50abb2e8c662a86edaf98245099cf4.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/467a0418ba50abb2e8c662a86edaf98245099cf4"" title=""power.png"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">power.png</span><span class=""informations"">871x653 625 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>Note, if you intend on attaching motors or other peripherals to your rig, then a wall power supply should not be used, as it will likely be unable to supply sufficient current to power everything. In this case, your best bet would be to use an actual OpenROV battery tube or other LiPo battery (a 3S LiPo battery works well).I set my prototyping board up so that I can cycle power by just disconnecting and connecting the ground wire on the 12V bus header that I stuck in. You can get as fancy as you want with this.Once you connect the power, the controller board should turn on, as well as the Beaglebone Black.Once the board is powered, the only thing left to do is to connect it to your development computer with an ethernet cable. You should automatically be assigned an IP address . If not, manually set up your computerâ€™s IPV4 configuration as follows:Address: 192.168.254.10<br>\nNetmask: 255.255.255.0There are a few different options for accessing the Beaglebone Black to work on the firmware. The first (and easiest) is to use the Cloud9 IDE that is installed on the Beaglebone. The other methods involve working at the command line through a terminal emulator.The Cloud9 IDE can be accessed by opening your browser on your host machine and connecting to the OpenROV Dashboard by entering either â€œopenrov.localâ€ù or â€œ<a href=""http://192.168.254.1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://192.168.254.1</a>â€ù as your URL. Once on the dashboard, you should see an option to launch the Cloud9 IDE. Click â€œCloud9â€ù to open it in another browser tab.Instructions for the development workflow over Cloud9 will be described in a later section.For more advanced users who might need to access the entire Beaglebone filesystem, you have three options. You can either use the terminal window in Cloud9 (which is conveniently logged in as root!), use the web-based terminal at <a href=""http://192.168.254.1:3009/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://192.168.254.1:3009/</a>, or directly SSH into the Beaglebone from your computerâ€™s terminal. If youâ€™re on a Linux of Mac machine, you should already have an ssh program installed. If on Windows, the easiest way to get a half-decent terminal with ssh is to just install the Git Bash client: <a href=""https://git-scm.com/download/win"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a>The command to connect over ssh is:Instructions for the development workflow over SSH will be described in a later section.The majority of files that will be of interest to the OpenROV firmware developer reside in the following locations:Firmware Sketch/Source Directory:Beaglebone Related Shell Scripts:Arduino Related Shell Scripts:Arduino Library Directory:All of the source files for the controller board firmware are located in the â€œ/opt/openrov/arduino/OpenROV/â€ù folder. The primary sketch file is named â€œOpenROV.inoâ€ù.When modifying or extending the firmware, you will mainly be working in this directory.There are two shell scripts that are commonly used in the firmware development process:Build and upload firmware:Reset the ATmega2560 (if you need to for some reason):Additional arduino libraries can be made available to the firmware build process by uploading them to the Arduino library folder:Using Cloud9 is the easiest way to directly modify and experiment with the OpenROV software. The following sections describe a general workflow for working with the controller board firmware.First, weâ€™ll add a build configuration to Cloud9 so we can easily build/upload the code with a single keystroke. Here are the steps:Delete the contents in the new .build file that was created and replace them with:Hit CTRL+S to save, and save as Firmware.build in the default location (.c9/builders/)Change your selected build configuration: click run-&gt;build systems-&gt;FirmwareYou can now make changes to any of the firmware source files (/openrov/arduino/OpenROV/*) and rebuild/upload them by pressing CTRL+B or going to Run-&gt;Build.Sometimes it is easier to work on the firmware source from your main computer, using an IDE like Visual Studio, Atmel Studio, or the Arduino IDE. One workflow is to clone the OpenROV firmware to your development computer from github, work on it in your preferred IDE, and then upload it back to the Beaglebone. To upload your source back to the Beaglebone after working on it, in Cloud9:Alternatively, you can just click the /openrov/arduino/ folder and upload your entire /OpenROV/ folder to more easily replace the entire source tree with the one from your computer.The folder will be compressed to a .tar.gz archive and downloaded to your computer. This can be done with any folder or file in the Cloud9 workspace.To access the built-in terminal window, you can go to â€œWindow-&gt;New Terminalâ€ù or hit Alt+T. The terminal logs in as root by default.If you want to develop from the command line, you have a number of options:Once youâ€™ve logged in in this manner, the general workflow is:If you need to install an application, library, or other package on the Beaglebone, you will need the Beaglebone to have an internet connection. Fortunately, we built a clever proxy into the Cockpit software that extends your development computerâ€™s internet connection to the Beaglebone through the browser. All you need to do is open the Dashboard (<a href=""http://192.168.254.1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://192.168.254.1</a>) in your PCâ€™s browser, and the Beaglebone will automagically be connected to the internet. If you close the Dashboard, this connection will be lost.You can upload and download files to the Beaglebone via command line by using the â€œscpâ€ù program from your host machine. scp transfers files over ssh. It is usually easier to upload or download files through the cloud9 interface, for most users.A typical scp upload of the source files might look like:A download might look like:The following is a brief overview of how the firmware is currently structured to help you get started.####Getting the software:Repository Location: <a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software-arduino"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software-arduino</a><br>\nNote: Be sure to checkout the 30.0.3 tag after cloning.The OpenROV controller board firmware is written in C++ using the Arduino core libraries. The entry point for the code resides in OpenROV.ino. Similar to any other Arduino sketch, you have a setup() function that is called once at the beginning of the program and a loop() function which is called continuously. The code is structured into five â€œmanagerâ€ù namespaces which are essentially singleton classes (without actually being classes) that group related sets of data and functions and make them available globally within the program.CModule describes a class that basically requires that any class derived from it have an Initialize() and Update( CCommand&amp; ) function. It also has a constructor that automatically registers any CModule derived class with the Module manager. In this manner, all you have to do to create a plugin that is part of the Initialize/Update flow in the program is to create a class that inherits from CModule and implement those two functions. In order to allow for conditional compilation and keep code size down, the headers for these derived classes consist of only a very simple class definition specifying that they inherit from CModule and implement the Initialize() and Update() functions. The actual functionality of each module is implemented in a private namespace in the moduleâ€™s .cpp file. This is where you define any data and functions that belong to the module.Instances of modules are created in ModuleDefinitions.h. If you look at that file, you can see that we are conditionally including and instancing modules based on the #define settings in AConfig.h. In this manner, if you donâ€™t use a module, it doesnâ€™t get included in the compilation process and code size is kept down. Some of the core modules are:There are also some other classes, utilities, and libraries included that are used by the various modules, such as CPIDController, CTimer, CPin, Utility.h/cpp, LibBNO055_X, etc.That covers most of the code structure at a pretty high level. We are still in the process of refactoring a lot of the code to make it more generic, clean, modular, flexible, platform agnostic, and efficient. As these changes occur, this guide will be updated with better supporting documentation.",Fe3C,"Amazing work, Charles! Thanks a lot.

Jim_Scholz,"I have been thinking about ways to reduce the leak possibility on the dry portion of my ROV. One thought is to pressurize the dry chamber before the dive. If I took the internal pressure to 150psig, then at 330â€™ it would be equal to ambient pressure.  Has anyone experimented with this before?A second thought is to install a strong bladder such as a hot water bottle inside the dry chamber and plumb it to the wet side. This would allow equalization at all depth.The concept is so simple, I am sure that I am missing something obvious that would not allow it to work.Thoughts?",Douglas_Butler,"If your bladder is filled with seawater then the buoyancy of the ROV will be reduced by the weight of the water.  You will never keep it trimmed.  Also if you bladder pressurized the chamber to 150 PSI (10 atmospheres) it would have to occupy 90% of the chamber volume.Pressurizing with air gives you a potential explosion hazard at the surface.  Probably a bad idea.  Also you would need a different way to secure the endcaps as the current method assumes negative internal pressure.Also note that O rings seal best with significant pressure across them.  When there is little pressure, or worse yet alternating positive and negative pressure the O rings work back and forth in their slot and tend to leak.",Jim_Scholz,Excellent points!  I have been around long enough to know just how little I do know and to appreciate the fact that there are always smarter people in the room. THANKS for the input.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

geoffreyash,"Finally got my grabber arm workingâ€_on the bench at least.  Have went through a few trial and error iterations and design changes since I started with the idea.  So now that itâ€™s working Iâ€™ll post it up here and hopefully someone smarter than me can tell me how to make it even better.Basic concept was the servo mechanism inside a waterproof enclosure, coupled to the grabber by magnets.I wanted simpleâ€_I donâ€™t have access to fancy 3d printing or even much in the way of materials locally, so the build itself was really a concept on paper and then a â€œfigure it out as I wentâ€ù, along with â€œwhat do I have here that could work for that?â€ù methods.  So naturally itâ€™s not a well documented build process.Not the cheapest setup, the servo alone was about $100.  I used an<a href=""https://www.actuonix.com/L16-R-Miniature-Linear-Servo-For-RC-p/l16-r.htm"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> actuonix linear servo</a> with a VERY strong magnet attached to the head (under the blue balloon â€œbellowsâ€ù).  I went with the L16 RC version because it can run on 3-5v.  For specs I chose 50mm stroke (seemed like a good lengthâ€_) and 63:1 gear ratio.  I wanted to make sure the servo wouldnâ€™t stall before the spring was fully extended.That whole assembly sits inside a modified OpenROV battery tube, and attached to the threaded rods under the bot.Itâ€™s attached to the claw on the outside by another magnet (plastic coated), aluminum rod and a spring (inside the grey aluminum tube)<br>\nI wanted a spring so the servo wouldnâ€™t stall once the claw closed on something.  Getting the right spring was a bit of trial and error, I wanted a least 10lbs of force at full extension, but less than 15 (the magnets would separate at about 15lbs of pull).  The one Iâ€™m using gives me 12 (measured with a luggage scale)For the claw itself, Iâ€™m just using a cut-off â€œpick up wandâ€ù from a dollar store. Simple design, all plastic, pretty strong.So it works! Now to get in the water and see what I need to do in terms of buoyancy and handling.  While itâ€™s not hard to remove, the idea is to just leave it on there all the time.I also plan to drill a couple holes in each claw â€œfingerâ€ù so that I can attach box-cutter blades and see if it works for line cutting.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/b/b2b47080239f5888e46d4864ce18277f789e4fc0.jpeg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/b2b47080239f5888e46d4864ce18277f789e4fc0"" title=""File_000 (9).jpeg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  alt=""File_000 (9)"" width=""375"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">File_000 (9).jpeg</span><span class=""informations"">3024x4032 2.33 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/f/f3fd3794ce55be417b64f6ea111eef6e20c1dd9a.jpeg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/f3fd3794ce55be417b64f6ea111eef6e20c1dd9a"" title=""File_001 (5).jpeg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  alt=""File_001 (5)"" width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">File_001 (5).jpeg</span><span class=""informations"">4032x3024 2.03 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/d/d08de95d801fa0800509b0448ac3b30245ad4db7.jpeg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/d08de95d801fa0800509b0448ac3b30245ad4db7"" title=""File_003.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  alt=""File_003"" width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">File_003.jpeg</span><span class=""informations"">4032x3024 2.11 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/2/26fcc100818def5ec02b330e771ca876f25ddbf7.jpeg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/26fcc100818def5ec02b330e771ca876f25ddbf7"" title=""File_002 (3).jpeg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  alt=""File_002 (3)"" width=""375"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">File_002 (3).jpeg</span><span class=""informations"">3024x4032 2.14 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>",Jim_Scholz,"I like this simple design.

Eric_Stackpole,"One of the concerns involving tethers is that if they contain a lot of wires and insulation, they can become very stiff which impedes the agility of the ROV.  Additionally, if tethers do not have added flotation they often sink in water which can weigh the ROV down.  A Two-Wire Tether can mitigate these issues by utilizing a <em>data over powerline</em> system which allows two very thin wires to communicate high bandwidth data (usually Ethernet) while also sending power to the ROV using standard 120v, 60Hz AC power. Because the wires are so small they don\",Wayne_Overla,The waterproof housing on your twisted pair will be a tricky endevour. If it is too stiff or heavy you defeat the purpose of a two wire tether. Do you have any solid ideas for the housing yet? It seems like coating it in liquid latex could have potential if you could UV protect it.,gfb,"Have you figured out how to fit the powerline ethernet converters in the ROV? I would be a little worried about the 120v going to the unit, would it work with 12v?The ROV itself looks finished, do you have a current tether system in place that is already working?",Eric_Stackpole,"Hay guys!In answer to your questions-Wayne, the tether itself will not require a waterproof housing- the wires are insulated sufficiently.  To check for the possibility of shorting due to permeability in the wire, I ran a test by putting a 35 foot sample of the wire in a jar of salt water for about a week and periodically measured for any detectable electrical continuity using a very sensitive ohm meter.  Resistance was always infinite.

Iâ€™m excited about this design because it is able to deliver that power and data together in standard forms using readily available components. Using standard 120vac (or even going to 240vac) has the tremendous advantage of having fairly inexpensive, off-the-shelf, inverters and (as you point out) GFCIs available, not to mention efficient switching power supplies for the bottom end.

Wild_Rover,"Hello all,I contacted a subsea cable supplier (Elmeridge Cables Ltd, they have been very helpful) in the UK and asked if they could supply a neutrally bouyant tether for the Open ROV.I specified a single twisted pair, 24 AWG, neutrally buoyant, yellow colour sheath, with as small an outer diameter possible.This is what they came back with:M.O.Q is 2000mtrs<br>\nSpec<br>\nNeutrally Buoyant 1 x 2 x 24AWG<br>\nconductor: tinned copper class 6<br>\nTape: non woven tape to hold the conductors in place<br>\nPulling Element: open Braid yarn<br>\nJacket: bright Yellow PUR<br>\nO.D 6.80mm<br>\nCable Weight 37.5kg/KMPrice 1.81 GBP per/mtrI have posted this here so that everyone can see this and have a chance to offer some feedback. As the minimum order quantity is 2000 m (there are, of course, substantial costs in providing a bespoke production run of cable, hence the M.O.Q.) a group purchase could be an option if we have enough interest.Tether management is one of the most important aspects of piloting a ROV and a neutrally buoyant tether, with a smooth profile (floats can add bouyancy but they also encourage entanglement and create tether handling issues.) would have many advantages.Of course, like anything, there are downsides with a larger tether spool required, more weight during transport, increased tether drag subsea, inherant stiffness of the tether - which could put a turning moment on the ROV etc.I thought I would post this here so that the Open ROV community can give their opinions.

You could try hooking up a voltmeter to the Arduino output, and seeing whether the average voltage seems sensible- if Iâ€™m doing my math right, a 1500 usec pulse at 60 Hz is about a 1% duty cycle, so the output pin should be about 1% of 5 Volts or about 50 mV.Or, if youâ€™re going to be doing a lot of this kind of work, Iâ€™d just break down and buy a servo tester.  Theyâ€™re not particularly expensive, and they come in very handy at times.  Hereâ€™s a typical one on Amazon:\n\nDescriptions: Can be synchronized output control 4 servos and used to compare the performance steering gear control of the steering servo output signal can be accurate to 2us (1 milliseconds = 1000 mi ...\n\n<strong>$10.88</strong>Hope that helps.

antoniocrocombe,Shielded or Unshielded Ethernet cables:  What would be the right choice for Internet Networking?,SFCable,"Digital Signal Processing is the process of transmission and production of data that takes place without any interference. This process asks for an Ethernet Cable. Most of the wired networks of today including routers, PCs and switches use Ethernet cables for the smooth transmission of data. These Ethernet Cables are of two types â€“ Shielded and Unshielded. They are also known as STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) and UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair). The question that arises next is - which one out of the two you should buy? To find this out, make sure you know about the environment you need Ethernet cables for.One of the major reasons behind networks slowing down is - voltage interference. Hence, you must make sure that the electrical line intersects with low voltage communication cable at 90 degrees.",antoniocrocombe,Thanks SFCable for comment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

carterhbond,"Hey everyone.  After being on the forum for a little bit of time, asking for help here and there. Iâ€™m happy to say that our ROV is mostly finished. It is going to be used in a regional MATE ROV Competition. We decided to go a little overkill for the â€œNavigatorâ€ù class of the competition but we wanted a ROV that could be reused for the years to come.  The ROV this year is named Red October.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/d/d64ab941d9a5b448d93e022e92a56f9e7597ff99.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/d64ab941d9a5b448d93e022e92a56f9e7597ff99"" title=""DSC_0555.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""690"" height=""458""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">DSC_0555.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">6016x4000 6.87 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>With the MATE ROV Comp. in mind, we had to design an ROV that would for their guidelines.  We probably would done some things differently but with the rules and guidelines of the competition, we could not. <img  title="":frowning:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":frowning:"">The ROV was built from ground up using the 2.8 Dev Kit. Our electronics housing is mounted on the two horizontal frame support aluminum tubes, held together with 3-D printed fittings. Mounting pieces for the housing were built on a milling machine. To maximize frame space we chose to keep the motors inboard. We use propeller shrouds to maximize the efficiency of our propellers. The accessories used to perform the tasks were designed with simplicity, functionality, and flexibility in mind. Two main accessories will complete the majority of all tasks, the claw and the â€œwhiskersâ€ù. The claw can move 90 degrees down and the claw opens and closes a reasonable amount.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/f/fac28cd7f4055a3e418cea32b4e4a3bae2be7f44.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/fac28cd7f4055a3e418cea32b4e4a3bae2be7f44"" title=""IMG_0453.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">IMG_0453.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">4032x3024 2.37 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>They are used for collecting multiple objects and completing multiple tasks.  The claw is a simple tool allowing for precise collection of hard to reach or capture objects.  The whiskers is made of a tube with 1/16in holes drilled through and in these holes, are rounded carbon fiber rods. Both of these tools retract into the frame maximizing the use of our size.There are a couple things we did change around.  The ROV is powered powered by a tether. The tether consists of a power line and ethernet cable. The power tether is 14 gauge and is about 50 ft long. If I remember correctly there is around a half volt drop from one end to the other.  The ethernet cable is used for data and communication. Two of the strands inside are used for communicating with the ROV, the leftover six strands are used for video. The extra cameras that are used are FPV cameras designed for RC products. To waterproof them, we pot them in Epoxy. The plastic cover is removed after the potting and the camera turns out rather clean looking.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/6/616b229a8dee62a87ed766288190af0eff9eb595.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/616b229a8dee62a87ed766288190af0eff9eb595"" title=""IMG_0442.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""375"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">IMG_0442.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">3024x4032 1.78 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>At the top end of the tether we made our little box for the topside adapter.

nathanperry,"Hello,<br>\nI thought I would share my home built towed camera sled since it shares much of the same tech as an ROV, minus the propulsion system. In fact, this sled morphed from an ROV, into the towed sled since I needed to be able to operate deeper than a simple ROV was going to allow.The camera is towed (very slowly) from the boat using an electric winch with slip-ring, on 1500â€™ of umbilical. The umbilical is made up of a cable with 2 pairs, and 7/64 Amsteel Blue rope. One pair feeds analog video up to the boat, and the other is used for RS-485 communications to control the cameras, power, and lights, as well as to send depth, temperature and other information. The Amsteel rope is needed because the camera sled weighs in at about 80 lbs in air (probably less than half that in water).The camera is self powered by a 30 amp/hour NiMH battery back, so the umbilical can be kept as small in diameter as possible. I get about 1 hour run time per battery pack with all of the main LED lights on.For my application, the lights consume 90% of the battery power. I run a ton of LED lights since I typically use the camera at depths over 300â€™, and here on the west coast its pretty much dark at that depth, so lots of light is needed for good quality footage. I record high definition video and stills using a few GoPro cameras, and the live video that is fed to the boat is just low resolution analog cameras, only used for navigation. I can switch between 4 different live cameras depending on what view I need.I have spent a lot of time getting the lighting and stability of this camera sled correct. It is still a work in progress. My footage is all from Southern California in water ranging from ~170â€™ to 1400â€™. Visit my youtube site for more footage.

antoniocrocombe,Take a look at some other aspects that you probably didnâ€™t know about CAT5E.,SFCable,"CAT 5E Cable is the successor of CAT5 cable and predecessor of CAT6 cable. CAT5E ethernet cables are mostly used for multi-line phone systems and networks. They are also used for plugging a computer or laptop into a modem for carrying internet connections. They have a maximum frequency of 100 MHz and are capable of transmitting up to 10/100/1000Mbps data. You might be aware of the uses of these networking cables. However, having some more details about these cables will help you understand its utility better.

It will not respond to IP 192.168.0.254 like the TP-Link N150 Wireless Travel Router that he used. I have been able to talk to it over its WiFi link and have changed the Working (Operating) Mode to â€œAPâ€ù per his instructions. I have then verified that I can talk to the router over the wired LAN Link at IP 192.168.0.254. However when I set the wired LAN link to a Static IP of 192.168.254.2, per his instructions, to be able to communicate with the OpenROV Cockpit, and reboot, I can no longer communicate with the router over the wired LAN link using IP 192.168.254.2 from my laptop.Perhaps this 300 Mbps version of the original 150Mbs router has substantially different operating firmware and may not work in this application?Apparently Nils Jakobi is no longer a member of the OpenROV Forum as I cannot send him a message or I would ask him directly.Any suggestions?Regards,TCIII AVD",TCIII,"Hi All,After searching the Amazon user reviews for the TP-LINK TL-WR802N Wireless N300 Travel Router it turns out, unlike the TP-Link N150 Wireless Travel Router, the TP-LINK TL-WR802N Wireless N300 Travel Router must be setup over its wireless link and not the wired LAN link as was done in Nils Jakobiâ€™s project.So I am going to have to figure out if the TP-LINK TL-WR802N Wireless N300 Travel Router can be setup over the wireless link the same way the TP-Link N150 Wireless Travel Router was setup over its wired LAN link.Regards,<br>\nTCIII AVD",TCIII,"Hi All,Good news! I was able to get the TP-LINK TL-WR802N Wireless N300 Travel Router communicating with the OROV 2.8 Controller Board.What I did is follow Nils Jakobiâ€™s instructions for setting up the Wireless Router, but did it over the Routerâ€™s wireless link instead of using the Ethernet LAN cable. Also, instead of selecting each setting individually like Nils did, I used the Quick Setup in the Wireless Routerâ€™s menu and set each parameter per his instructions as it came up in the Quick Setup dialogue.

That C++ program sent video over zeromq to the node server internally, which then got it up to the browser. The only other c++ program is the program that blinks the LED pattern on the BBB. Additionally, I made a fork of mjpgstreamer which has a new C++ plugin for transporting video over raw websockets using the uWebSocket library, such that the video could be served directly to the browser from mjpogstreamer rather than going through node, for performance reasons<br>\non trident, things are more heavily c++ and we are starting to support native clients in addition to the web client, but the node server is still there coexisting with the c++ programs which are handling video and the MCU interface9-00-15   As of 30.0.x, the system used MJPEG streaming for all video.

If so, just wondering if anyone can recommend how big of a supply to go with.Any help appreciated!<br>\nThanks,O",Brendan,"Gâ€™day,It will do it, but itâ€™s by no means a simple task. The only reason Iâ€™m suggesting itâ€™s possible is because youâ€™re not going too deep. The longer the cable run the more difficult it becomes. Is changing multiple sets of batteries an option for you? Itâ€™s probably the easier option.The ROV uses between 0.5A and 0.8A just to run the computers, With each motor using up to 10A. So youâ€™re probably looking at least a 20-30A 12V DC supply. A linear supply with voltage tracking would be a lot better than a switchmode, as the noise from a high current switchmode could interfere with the ROV or the network.You will need a big chunky cable to handle the current without getting a massive voltage drop too. About 8-10 AWG would probably be okay. But this will also introduce drag on your ROV and make it much less maneuverable.Are you planning to run the ROV just from the DC supply? or run it with the batteries on board as well and use a charge controller? Have you used the IMU wires or spare wires on your 2.7? You will need to use more than 1 pair of the wires potted thru the end-cap to handle the current. I would suggest using all the spare wires you have available.Cheers,<br>\nBrendan",openrov4,"I realize this is a bit late to the table but if you are able to run a higher voltage on the tether you can use smaller wire.  30A @ 12V is 360W but so is 7.8A @ 48V and the size of wire is related mostly to amperage.  If you put a DC/DC converter to take 48V in to 12V out you can use smaller wire.Wire sizing chart for a 2% loss says 12v @ 30A over 20â€™ needs <span class=""hashtag"">#2</span> but 48v @ 8A only needs <span class=""hashtag"">#14</span> or maybe <span class=""hashtag"">#16</span>.You also indicate the duty cycle is 10min out of 60min so if you can use an on board battery for your peak loads during the 10min running time and re-charge for 50min.  30A for 10min would only requite 6A for 50min to recover.   12v @ 6A = 72W = 48V @ 1.5A.  Again if I am reading them right the tables suggest <span class=""hashtag"">#16</span> wire for 1.5A over 20â€™ with a 2-3% power loss.<a href=""http://www.zetatalk.com/energy/tengy10s.pdf"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.zetatalk.com/energy/tengy10s.pdf</a>",wangshujun,"Usually, the cable loss of ROV can be accepted by 30%, but pay attention to the heat accumulation of the cable wrapped around the cable shaft.<br>\nThe higher voltage corresponds to a finer buoyant cable, which reduces the power loss of the cable while the ROV is moving.

bogus105,"Hi folks!This is my first post on this forum. ROV is something i was thinking about since years and now i decided to go into it. Iâ€™m after reading tons of topics on all ROV related forums on the web and have built some knowledge base.I divided my concerns about ROV into the following blocks:Note my main assumptions are: cost effective, diy made parts, 100m - 150m water depths operation, tether lenghts up to 250m, video stream 1080p.As for onboard ROV  control system iâ€™m thinking about PixHawk autopilot platform + Raspberry Pi3 + 1080p usb H.264 camera or Raspberry Pi ribbon cable camera. You may know this type of control system from <a href=""http://ArduSub.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">ArduSub.com</a> or bluerobotics. Yes, the idea came from those sites.<br>\nThe only part of the system i do not like is the Fathom-X ethernet-twisted pair modules.

Is it really necessary to use some kind of amplifier between onboard ROV Raspberry Pi3 ethernet connector and surface? Iâ€™m aiming at 250 meters of cable. Would it be good for 1080p video stream, telemetry and control?Second idea is fiber optics - single fiber cable. I saw many ROV builders was talking about some sort of video-to-fiber converters + data channel (RS-485). But Why canâ€™t we use standars fiber optics iethernet routers like this one:<a href=""http://www.tp-link.com/us/products/details/cat-43_MC111CS.html#overview"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.tp-link.com/us/products/details/cat-43_MC111CS.html#overview</a>It use one fibre for two way transmission: 1550 nm wavelenght on TX and 1310 nm on RX. On the other side on the tether MC112CS should be used. According to specs 20km long hi speed transmission can be established this way.So it can looks like this:PixHawk+Raspberry Pi3 &lt;-&gt; TP-Link MC112CS &lt;-&gt; fiber optics tether &lt;-&gt; TP-Link MC111CS &lt;-&gt; PC/Tablet/RaspberryPi3 (i wonder if QGroundControl platform can be installed on Raspberry Pi3 ???).<br>\nNote MC112CS max power consumption is 2,5 W (according to scpes) wchich is nice for onboard powered ROVs.<br>\nWhat you think about such system?",mikebardsley61,"I am working on an ROV project with a group that builds underwater video and lighting systems.  We have gone over this idea also.  You have to also look at one key element, thatâ€™s your Tether and its cost.  For the shorthaul fiber your looking at a tether that would contain 2 strands of MM(Multimode) fiber.  Expensive!  We went a cheaper route, and used a very common tether that includes a standard Coax core plus a few 14g and 18g pairs for power and features.<br>\nI found that I can run a standard non IP based camera, and inject the IP based info on a MOCA IP Extender system by D-Link or Trendnet.  Cost for a this on each side is running around $50 and I can push around 80Mg of data across the link and run up to 1000ft with no issue.  That gives me the ability to run a few 4Mg IP cameras, and companion computers with out any issues by placing a nano switch in the ROV, and a standard WIFI router topside behind the MOCA devices.",bogus105,"Thank you Mike!If i understand you right 2 strands MM fiber looks like two separate cables sticked together, right? Ifso the TP-link devices i was talking about use one strand fiber optics cable as transmission go throug one fiber string. TX and RX light signals have different wavelenghts thus making it possible to go in opposite directions through the same fibre withuot mixing/interference. Correct me if i am wrong.Would you be so kind and explain your system in more detail? What non-IP cameras are you talking about? Coaxial tether instead of fiber sounds very interesting. I guess it is not only cheaper but more resistant to mechanical wear/bends/strain etc. Is this right?More than one camera is also nice feature.

My intention is to put them into a BlueROV2 that Iâ€™m modifying with completely new electronics.  I want to be able to run 500-600m tether lengths without using a repeater.Note that VDSL2 modems require significantly more power than Homeplug AV2 gear - about 5-6 watts per side, if you believe the documentation.

See, for instance, the Boxfish ROV.  It might actually be a pretty good model of what you are trying to build.The ROV electronics that Iâ€™m designing will support 8 thrusters through individual UARTs, for fine control of motor parameters.

Quasar,"Hi guys,Im on a mission to build my first ROV and Iâ€™m looking around to get inspiration for my design. Everywhere I look I only see tube based designs.

Any feedback is welcome.Thanks in advance",Brendan,"Itâ€™s not impossible to have a cube shaped pressure vessel. However tube based designs are a lot stronger under pressure, require less wall thickness and are less likely to collapse. They are also more hydrodynamic.What to you want to achieve with your ROV design? If youâ€™re planning to operate it in shallow areas with low current, a cube might be sufficient. If you want to operate your ROV in the ocean or perform some deeper dives a tube based design would perform a lot better.Since you already have an open frame design it seems like a shame to add all that additional drag from a large cube on top of it.",Quasar,Thanks Brendan for your feedback. I only intend to dive the ROV to depths of about 5m. Do you have any recommendations on a tube vessel that I can put there instead of the cube? Iâ€™m mainly concerned about the space because I plan to have many electronics in there.,Brendan,"A cube should be ok at 5m. There is software called â€œunder pressureâ€ù that you can use to model your design and figure out what depth itâ€™s failure points will occur, e.g. wall buckling, vessel collapse etcâ€_  Since you are operating at a very low depth a cube might be a better solution for a large electronics payload. You can also incorporate some internal bracing into your design to increase itâ€™s strength if needed. What material do you plan to build your enclosure from? Or are you going to use a pre-built enclosure?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If this speed is too fast for your needs, thereâ€™s not a whole lot youâ€™re going to be able to do about it, since the ESC will not properly commutate at slower speeds.ESCs can be made to run slower, by driving the motor in a fashion akin to a stepper motor.  On the upcoming Trident, we do this at slow motor speeds to enhance the slow-speed controllability of the ROV.

Does someone knows how can i make it?<br>\nThnx!!",Ion,"Iâ€™ve seen those devices working on RC submarines models. Its made from what looks like a syringe.<br>\nWhen the piston moves, air volume changes, and hence buoyancy. Anyway, the working depth range of those devices is very limited.In order to hold a given depth, hydrostatic equilibrium must be achieved, and that only depends on the relation between weights and buoyancy. At the same time, the only way to control buoyancy with these devices is by means of changing volume.<br>\nHence, given that water is uncompressible, the volume of the tank, and hence, internal prssure, will be the same at any depth in order to achive the hydrostatic balance.<br>\nIt means that external pressure working on the tank walls and the external face of the piston will increase with depth.<br>\nTwo problems arrive:<br>\n1-) Any distortion on the syringe shape will lead to buoyancy loss, water leakeages and/or to the piston to get stuck, making impossible any further manouver.<br>\n2-) If no distortion happens, force required in order to move the piston â€œoutâ€ù of the syringe has increased proportionally to depth.For low depths, were pressure differential can be taken as negligible, it works fine, but for the usual depth range of Rovs, I see that system possible , but not practical as there are better solutions.Regards",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jim_Trezzo,"This discussion is about developing an acoustic based location system for small ROVs.Much of the early work that we have been doing is in the blog: <a href=""http://community.openrov.com/profiles/blogs/acoustic-modems-location-and-pingers"" target=""_blank"" name=""OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1747_com_zimbra_url"">http://community.openrov.com/profiles/blogs/acoustic-modems-location-and-pingers</a>That blog covers broader topics, so I wanted to start this discussion specifically for developing the acoustic location system.Knowing where you are when exploring and gathering images and data is clearly a vital piece of information.  GPS systems provide this on land.  Underwater, radio waves that GPS depends on to function are absorbed by water.  Acoustic signals are one of the best alternatives to transmit information for location and other data communication.  Commercial underwater modem systems exist today and are widely used in exploration, but suitable systems for low-cost small size platforms like OpenROV are not available.  This project plans to deliver such a system and is in-part inspired by university research in this area â€“ Bridget Bensonâ€™s UCSD PhD Thesis <a href=""http://kastner.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/admin/phd-thesis-benson.pdf""></a><a href=""http://kastner.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/admin/phd-thesis-benson.pdf"">http://kastner.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/admin/phd-thesis-benson.pdf</a> is one example.<span>Information about 3D location in real-time is a key enabler for many scientific and exploratory needs. The technology to do this is known, but has not been scaled down for systems of this size. With location information, one could map any discoveries (sunken ships, archeological sites, and coral reefs are some examples). Maps of the ocean/lake/cave can be made with location and sensor information together. Virtual Reality and 3D gaming technology could be used to represent information about an exploration either in real-time (shared over the internet) or archived for many to explore on-line as they study results of explorations.</span><span>The technical approach is to use acoustic transmissions (ultrasonic sonar) from known locations on the surface (GPS would be used to maintain location of the sender). The ROV would have a receiver unit on board and can determine the time for the signal to arrive. That information along with depth, temperature and the on-board IMU (gyro, compass, accelerometers) would be used to determine/compute location. Location information would be available to the operator of the ROV and a graphical display could be developed (possibly in conjunction with maps of the bottom if available) to help with navigation.</span><span>Current status and near term work items:</span><span>Working designs for ultrasonic Power AMP and receiver exist and initial testing with 40KHz piezoelectric transducers has begun.  A micro-controller or processor can be used to generate a 40KHz square wave pulse which is shaped and amplified into a sine wave to drive the transducer.  Currently the amplifier produces a 27Vp-p signal.  If testing shows that this is not enough to generate a powerful enough ultrasonic pulse, a step-up transformer may be required.</span><span>The high gain (&gt; 100), high input impedance (FET front end) receiver amplifier design includes a narrow band pass filter to allow only frequencies in the desired range to be amplified.  This receiver needs to be packaged and integrated with the ROV electronics along with a micro-controller </span>to process the waveform (&gt;100 samples/sec and real-time FFT processing required).  System level: Some how the timing for the start of the pulse from each transmitter (correlated with GPS location at time of transmission) must be matched against the time the first pulse is received (any delayed echoes would be rejected).  The time of travel for the pulse would be used to calculate the distance from the transmitter (with know location) and along with depth information, water temperature, salinity (salt or fresh) and IMU data (plus and location history - dead reckoning, etc.) location would be determined. Data from a second transmitter some distance from the first would greatly help the calculation (see <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/35310/76883909.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Virtual Long Baseline VLBL Navigation</a>).  The transmissions and calculations should be able to be done every tenth of a second to provide timely location.I will establish a location on GitHub for this project and start to organize existing material there.  for now, take a look at the blog <a href=""http://community.openrov.com/profiles/blogs/acoustic-modems-location-and-pingers"" target=""_blank"" name=""OBJ_PREFIX_DWT1747_com_zimbra_url"">http://community.openrov.com/profiles/blogs/acoustic-modems-location-and-pingers</a>.It would speed things up if I got some help with the micro-controller software while I continue with the electronics and in the water testing.  To do: sample the signal and determine when a 40KHz pulse arrives.  FFT analysis would be the likely approach.  Also will need to determine which micro-controller is adequate to handle this processing load.  I can probably collect some raw data samples using my NI VirtualBench if someone just wants to work on the FFT part.There are a few folks already interested, and some possibility of collaboration is there.If you are interested in getting involved, please let me know and what area(s) you think you can hep with.Regards,Jim Trezzojim@openrov.comor jtrezzo@trezco.com",Scott_W,"First off, I have to thank Jim and Bob getting this sub project/payload kicked off and started and for the work they have collectively done to date.

This would give us the ability to track true motion over ground and can be used as an altimeter. If we were able to have bottom lock on the DVL and GPS the navigation uncertainty could be kept to a minimum.,Troy,Sorry commenting from my phone my idea is to start on the surface get a GPS fix and DVL bottom lock then submerge and use the DVL to keep position uncertainty to a minimum.,Bob_Anderson,"It is great to have this set up as a forum and also get a code repository started. I donâ€™t know if there is a way to do it, but feel free to move any of my previously posted materials that apply here. Iâ€™ll try and clean up the GPS gated timing work and post it to the forum also. Getting a GPS disciplined Stratum-1 NTP server working to see how accurately one can sync the Beaglebone clock over the 2 wire Ethernet is planned, but that may be a bit later. I havenâ€™t worked out the math, but if you are using two surface pingers with known transmission times and locations and have a synced clock on the ROV and depth, I think you have the information(along with the things Jim mentioned) required to calculate location. First cut would probably be to just fix the distance between the transmitters.Bob",Douglas_Butler,"I have done work on LBL acoustic nav systems including SHARPS for WHOI and SNAP for Imetrix, including transmitter, receiver, and timing box design.There is no need to shape the transmit pulse into a sine wave, the Q of a piezoelectric ducer will do that for you.  The SNAP system puts a 24V 4 cycle 300kHz square wave into a 4:100 turn transformer to get 600V (about 1kW) at the 1/4"" piezo hemisphere.

Ronald_Peters,"Has anyone done any work with the Acrylic cylinder by way of using a thicker/larger/stronger tube for really deep diving version?   I now that I can get 6"" x 0.25 tube but not sure how much pressure it will resist.",Walt_Holm,"Hi Ronald:Here at OpenROV HQ weâ€™ve done a fair amount of testing of various tubes, both in our pressure chamber at the lab (which can go down to 200m), and at Lake Tahoe.The 3/16"" tubes that ship with the kit will consistently survive to 180-200m in our pressure chamber, so there is a decent amount of margin there in the rated 100m depth for the 2.8 ROV.Weâ€™ve built a number of test ROVs using 1/4"" thick tubes and thicker endcaps, and have dove them in Lake Tahoe down to 280m.  The limiting factor seems to be acrylic endcaps- it is just very hard to make a flawless acrylic endcap that will not fail at those kind of pressures.This spring weâ€™ll be doing another round of deep diving testing at Tahoe, using endcaps turned from PVC, and some thicker tubing.For you question specifically, I think 1/4"" tubing will be good down to 300-350m.  Deeper than that, Iâ€™d go with a 3/8"" tube.-W",Brian_Grau,"Just to add a few notes onto what <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/walt_holm"">@Walt_Holm</a>  said.We did various testing of endcaps back with the 2.7 with different variables (not enough acrylic cement bonding layers, dirty pieces of acrylic, etc.) These survived down to the 130psi- 170psi range. What we consider â€œuser quality good endcapsâ€ù survived down to the 200psi (~125m) range. In order to survive past this depth you have to have to have pretty flawless endcaps which is difficult to achieve. There is ultimately a limiting factor with the 6mm sheet of acrylic and some of the testing that Walt mentioned was with 9mm acrylic or other materials.The yield strength of acrylic also varies widely and some of this is manufacturer dependent. These can be anywhere between about 5ksi and 10ksi. At a certain point the only way to get good data is to do actual testing.There is a free piece of software called [Under Pressure] (<a href=""http://www.deepsea.com/knowledgebase/design-tools/under-pressure-design-software/"">http://www.deepsea.com/knowledgebase/design-tools/under-pressure-design-software/</a>) that lets you easily do some of these initial design calculations.",Ronald_Peters,By the responses so far Iâ€™m hearing that it is the end caps that are the weakest point.

Make sure you post some photos of what you do here, as weâ€™re all curious to see what youâ€™re creating.-W",Douglas_Butler,"Here is some hard won trivia about making watertight endcaps.  Endcaps should generally be made from plate and not from round stock.  Large round stock of many materials, especially plastics and aluminum, tend to have porosity at the center.  If you cut a disk off of a rod you may find the disk leaks slowly right through the apparently solid material at the center.The cause is actually quite simple.  As the round stock is produced it is quite hot and expanded.  When it cools it cools from the outside.  Thus the outside becomes cool and rigid while the inside is still hot, soft, and expanded.  When the inside cools it wants to shrink but with the rigid exterior there is nowhere to shrink from.  So you end up with microscopic tendrils of vacuum running generally along the center of the round stock.  When you cut a disk from the rod the tendrils of vacuum become pipes through the thickness of the disk.  This is at the center of cooling which is not always exactly at the physical center of the rod.  This does not happen with plate stock as when center of the plate cools the whole plate just gets slightly thinner.",bigdbut,"Dear Sirs<br>\nI have a spec sheet on acrylic.

When cured properly, it is optically clear. â€˜Properlyâ€™ by the potting method I have devised over time is as follow:Use a heat gun to warm up the epoxy. If you are using an injector nozzle be sure to keep the epoxy tube right side up, with the nozzle on. As you heat it up make sure the epoxy tube doesnâ€™t warp, if it starts to flex just lay off the heat a bit. But you really want the individual parts (unmixed) to be be warm all the way to the core of the tube. Doing this in an upright position allows trapped air to escape in your first few pumps. As it heats up, the viscosity drops, and it flows with much less effort. The first few pumps should be disposed of, as lots of trapped air bubbles will come out at this time.Additionally, warm up the thing you are about to pot. I generally find it better to use a lower heat setting, passing warm air over a surface for a longer amount of time vs. a hotter air shorter time.Allow it to cure in a warm environment, it can get cloudy if the temperature is not consistent throughout the entire process.However I havenâ€™t potted a camera, only other components.

It is often less that rechargeable.  An alkaline cell of 1.5v typically has roughly the same amp-hour capacity as say a NiHM cell but a higher internal resistance and is only capable of putting out  something like 50 to 100 mill-amp continuous where a NiMH cell might be capable of several amps continuous.  Batteries are often rated as nnC (ex. 10C) where the 10 is the multiplier over the amp hour rating you can draw continuously.

Thank you very much!I would really appreciate to know what you calculate for mass and displacement for 1m of that spectra line.

If you are planning on weaving the spectra into the rov cable then I think it would be a more applicable method.Thanks again Robert!!!,Brian_Grau,The numbers I sent are for one tether that I measured. The weights and displacement do vary a little from tether to tether. Just something to keep in mind with your calculations.,Zack,"Yeah, I want to reiterate Brian Gâ€™s point. The tether shipped with OpenROV can vary significantly from bundle to bundle and even within a bundle there is variation. Might be a good idea to overestimate the math on it so that if you are off your tether is a little more floaty than sinky in seawater.Eager to see how this turns out,Z",aelynn38,"Clarification question for Brian and Zack -Is the variability in shipped tethers caused by differences in the length of shipped tethers, air bubbles in coiled submerged tethers, or by actual variation in the tether caused by the manufacturing process?I would imagine that these wires are mass-produced by machinery that doesnâ€™t cause much variability but I could be wrong.-Andy",Zack,"Yeah!When speaking about the stock twisted pair on the OpenROV 2 series, the variation is from the manufacturer and is caused by variation in jacketing thickness. They are made with mass-produced machinery but there is variation from unit to unit and along the length of the unit.The actual length of the wire is pretty tight but might also contribute to the variance in weight we are seeing. Iâ€™m not sure to what degree.Z",robert_swarner,"Iâ€™ll definitely weigh mine. I ordered the line I linked to, and iâ€™ll report back here with some estimates!",BlueRoamer,"I can say from my experience with both fly fishing and trying to get my tether to remain neutral that a fly line will be a bit light. Hereâ€™s what I have done. I unwound using my trusty drillâ€_a 6mm - 3 strand poly rope and wound the tether back into it.

thua,"Hello,Currently I have an OpenROV 2.6 with the ethernet plug connected to a raspberry pi, and the pi forwards all packets wirelessly to a laptop. I was wondering how feasible it would be to capture the video stream onto an SD card on the pi, as I know doing so on the BBB would cause crashes/slowdowns since compression is very CPU intensive. Currently I am capturing a video stream using VLC laptop side, but I wanted to capture the video before it streamed to the laptop in the case of cutouts/dropped packets. Thanks for the help!T. Hua",uzzors2k,"Iâ€™ve accomplished this without problems. However I used a raspberry pi on both the transmitting and receiving ends, with the raspberry pi camera (and not some generic USB webcam). What I did was pipe the video feed from raspivid through gstreamer. The ROV would host a server, and optionally save the video to disk at the same time. The tether-side raspberry pi would attempt to set up a client connected to the ROV, and simply display the received feed. Delay was unnoticeable in the video feed. Iâ€™m sure storage of the live video feed can be moved to the receiving unit, although I had a specific reason for not doing so, which I no longer remember.If you want, I can go through my notes and provide some more information. I plan on doing a write-up some time soon anyway, and releasing the source code open source. Until then you can watch the video I just posted in another thread to see how it behaves:",thua,Thank you very much for the help!

megs.malpani,"Hey Fellow Marine Enthusiasts!My name is Megs and I am an intern at OpenROV this summer! I wanted to introduce myself to the community and say how excited I am to be a part of this incredible movement. I just completed my Freshman year at Brown University and am planning on double concentrating in Computer Science and Marine Ecology. In my free time, I enjoy sailing, snorkeling, and SCUBA diving (really anything on the ocean ;))!This summer, my goal is to contribute to the citizen science movement by creating a plugin in the ROV that allows user to collect and share data that evaluates the water column (temperature, light, etc. with respect to depth) when flying the ROV. I am really excited about this project because it brings together my passions in both CS and Marine Biology. So far, my plan is to break this project into two key parts:Part 1: Create a browser plug in that collects various sensor data with respect to depth. At the end of the dive, the water column profile should be visually displayed to the user, and a â€œsync to cloudâ€ù button in the cockpit will allow this data to be sent to the cloud with various other metrics (including GPS, date, time, and sensor specs) that will later enable us to qualify the data. We want to capture and store the raw sensor data, calibration,  and the meta data around the precision and general performance of the sensor in use. While we will calibrate the OpenROV sensors ourselves, users can expand the scope of the ROV by adding their own sensors and calibrations (we are open source after all).Part 2: Create a data search engine that parses all the data sets collected by the OpenROV community and returns the selected sets that meet given specifications. The search parameters will include time of year, location, type of data (what sensor), and data resolution. We will determine data resolution based on sensor specs (that the user must enter - i.e. how long the temp sensor takes to adjust to changes and read an accurate value). Essentially we will use the rate of change in depth to evaluate what parts of the data are meaningful.Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts/ideas/concerns/suggestions regarding this project!Thanks for reading!<br>\nMegs",megs.malpani,"I have spent the past month finishing Part One of my project - developing a plugin (using Polymer and D3) that allows users to visualize the water column from the real-time data theyâ€™re collecting. I spent a lot of time fine tuning my plug in, and some of the key features I added include:<br>\n-the ability to create these graphs for any kind of sensor data (not just temperature)<br>\n-transparent dots at every data point that have a mouse over function that not only fills in the dot but also displays the depth and average sensor value at that point.<br>\n-transitions - i.e. continuous animations between the changing graphs (new axes, data points, etc) so I donâ€™t have to completely regraph with every additional data point.Now itâ€™s time to work on Part 2: making sure this data is usable and available to scientists.<br>\nYesterday, we went to Monterey to fly our ROVs and I got the opportunity to test my plugin in the ocean. I collected two separate data sets, for one of which my plugin displayed the following graph (I forgot to save the other graph though it looked similar):<br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/b/bf0370ca350cd5840fbcfe95faabb929ebc8e4c1.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/bf0370ca350cd5840fbcfe95faabb929ebc8e4c1"" title=""Screen Shot 2016-07-18 at 3.48.03 PM.png"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""690"" height=""440""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Screen Shot 2016-07-18 at 3.48.03 PM.png</span><span class=""informations"">723x462 26.1 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><br>\nThe big issue now is evaluating how precise and accurate the temperature sensor is in the IMU. Iâ€™m worried there is a lag, or at least that the sensor takes a while to give an accurate reading. Today, I took the actual temp and depth data sets (from what I collected yesterday) and plotted them against time to create the following graphs:<br>\n<img  width=""600"" height=""371""><br>\n<img  width=""600"" height=""371""><br>\nFrom these graphs it actually seems as if the temperature sensor is pretty responsive though the first quarter of the first graph indicates it does take some time to fully register temperature changes related to depth (the ROV flies from the surface down to 2 meter rapidly multiple times, and though the temperature line does reflect this change in depth, the fluctuation is much less than what would be expected based on the rest of the graph).<strong>So hereâ€™s my ask for all the Oceanographers and Marine Scientists reading this</strong>: How can I make this data more useful to you? Obviously knowing information about the water column and changing thermoclines is valuable, especially taking climate change and the recent El NiÃ±o in consideration, but is this data as is, helpful? What other data would you need to qualify the data (i.e. rate of change when that datum was taken, time spent within a meter of that depth when the datum was recorded, etc)? We have the sensor specs <a href=""http://meas-spec.com/product/pressure/MS5837-30BA.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">here</a>, and Iâ€™d love any suggestions/input you might have. The goal is to ultimately collect enough data around the world to monitor the changing water columns.Thanks for your time!<br>\nMegs",Scott_W,"HI <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/megs.malpani"">@megs.malpani</a>First off Congrats on what you have done to dateJust a couple of thoughts (not so much on your key questions but on some simple temperature control theory)Hopefully none of this is telling you how to suck eggsFrom your postThe big issue now is evaluating how precise and accurate the temperature sensor is in the IMU. Iâ€™m worried there is a lag, or at least that the sensor takes a while to give an accurate readingFrom these graphs it actually seems as if the temperature sensor is pretty responsive though the first quarter of the first graph indicates it does take some time to fully register temperature changesDonâ€™t worry too much about this all sensors (and temperature is one of the worst) have a Dead Time or Lag / Delay from a change to the sensed valueThe easiest way to measure or characterise this lag is just to start recording temperature with the unit out of the water and plunge it into the water and watch for the time it takes for the sensor to basically equilibrate with the surrounds. This is the Time Constant (think of it as a bit of resistance or inertia for temperature movement) and is characterised for the time it takes to get to 63% (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_constant"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Time Constant</a>) of the final value (I would expect most of the OROVâ€™s to be pretty similar in the bigger picture i.e. within a couple of seconds of each other) A rule of thumb is that a system needs the equivalent of 10 dead times to settle.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/1/12d660e12390987b236c692a04181654d70a674f.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/12d660e12390987b236c692a04181654d70a674f"" title=""steptest.png"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""690"" height=""406""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">steptest.png</span><span class=""informations"">803x473 22.2 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>You could thenHope this is of some helpScott_W",md2879,"Hi <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/megs.malpani"">@megs.malpani</a>!I just found out about OpenRov and your project seems awesome. I am studying oceanography in England and the idea of being able to use these systems to study coastal water columns is really awesome and great way to build up data sets.I am currently studying coastal shelf mixing and variations in the thermocline and we were also getting an issue with the lags. Part of the reason this a big issue for us is that whoever is out taking measurements seems to give a different amount of time before deploying our equipment( Generally CTDâ€™s). We got around this by putting in a warning box that counts down to a fixed amount of seconds then tells the user to deploy the equipment on a downcast , which seems to work pretty well, though it is definitely  far more simple since we mainly do stationary downcasts.

This project came to life when we realized that the OpenROV community is, and has been, unintentionally collecting large amounts of fine-grain coastal thermocline data around the world, when flying their ROVs. This made us wonder, how can we best put this data to use? Our solution is a platform in which scientists, government agencies, NGOs, and others can search for data sets collected by citizen scientists, to study and monitor the water column in real time. Having data available would be invaluable for environmental management purposes, or to use it to help inform legislators and congress members about changing ocean conditions and how best to adapt to them. Not only will this project scale the data collection process, but it will do so for free.<strong>Features include the ability to:</strong><br>\n-apply initial filters based on what data sets youâ€™re interested in.<br>\n-sort the resultant data based on date, max depth, types of data and location.<br>\n-search for a specific date, type of data, location, or max dive depth.<br>\n-download a data file (as a csv) with a single click (the data file will contain much more information: the gps coordinates, userâ€™s notes on the weather, the sensorâ€™s specs, the actual data, etc)<strong>The site has not been released yet and before we do so, we would love your feedback in the following areas as you look through the demo below (calling all oceanographers, conservationists, etc)</strong>:<br>\n-What would make this page more useful? Having a map? Is it good as it?<br>\n-Are there any other filters youâ€™d want on the website?<br>\n-What other information would you want to see in the data file (outside of time, depth, temp, and other sensor values) to make the data more useful? (i.e rate of change when data was collected)<br>\n-Is the high level data useful in itself even if it doesnâ€™t have absolute precision (slight lag in the temperature sensor)?

They are designed to work in salt water with a minimum of maintenance and are a premium thruster for the price. I have used them in my <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/blue-robotics-openrov-2-8-hybrid-rov/4727"">Hybrid ROV project</a>.For those on a budget, the OROV DST-700 brushless motors are a good choice, but may have a limited life when used only in salt water environments, though proper maintenance will definitely enhance their life expectancy.The bilge pump conversions have a limitation in that they use a rubber seal around the pumpâ€™s motor shaft that can possibly tighten up due to the pressure at greater depths reducing their performance and the life expectancy of the seal. They are good for MATE types of competition in swimming pools.Regards,<br>\nTCIII AVD",jwlj,"Thank you. If I can convince my professor to help with the costs through her grant, I think I am going to splurge on the BR T100 motors. (But only if I am keeping this ROV and not handing it over to the University after Iâ€™m done).Are the bilge motors okay for saltwater? If not, Iâ€™ve seen people potting, or covering brushless motors with wax to help waterproof.I am very much impressed with your ROV. Looks like you are a Navy man. If you happen to be in Norfolk, Iâ€™d love to see your rig. (Iâ€™m prior Navy myself.)Iâ€™m still learning this all, and have a lot to read still before I start my project.

William_Smith,"Has anyone looked into 802.3af or 802.3at Power Over Ethernet for use in tethers?  This will get you up to gigabit Ethernet and 15 or 30 (60 and more are evolving) watts of power.Note that this is not the ""Voltage on the spare pairs"" thing that some folks call Power Over Ethernet, but a standard for putting 50-ish volts on the (spare and) data wires and using all four pairs for power and data (hence the gigabit with 60W options).  Turns out heating in the wire is one of the issues with the higher-power versions, which will probably be less of an issue in this application.  8*)You can get gel-filled ""direct burial"" CAT5 wire, but it might be easiest to use a flexible (patch cable) CAT5 wire and replace it as needed.  100-foot CAT5 cables are $20-ish, and if the underwater connections are RJ45s filled with silicone grease it might be waterproof enough to work for enough dives to make it a consumable.Anyone know what the buoyancy of CAT5 patch wire is?",Charlie,"One could also just use a remote sense DC power supply to deliver a desired supply voltage at whatever the current limit for your tether is.

Achraf,"Hello all,I am very excited to start building an OpenROV soon, I love the idea and can\",Walt_Holm,"t care what voltage they get- the higher the voltage, the more power.  They still deliver plenty of power at the lower voltage of the LiFePO4 cells.   The schematic for the 2.6 Controller board is on the OpenROV Github site in the openrov-electronics folder, in pdf form.  There is no current top-level drawing showing the hookups to the controller board, but it is not hard to figure out when you look at the wiring instructions for the DB-25 connector on Dozuki.   The battery you link will work just fine, but.......   Changes like this always have a ripple effect through the entire design.  If you just want to build the ROV and get on with flying it, I would stick with the existing 26650 LiFePO4 batteries.  If you like tinkering with your own designs, then it is an interesting exercise to design your own battery pack.  A couple of issues if you want to use 38120 cells like the one you linked-- These cells are BIG, so you",kyril_acap,"Hello, good day,<br>\nsorry for posting on this thread instead of new one, iâ€™ve just receive my OROV 2.8 kit, but i dont purchase the battery together. been lookin inside forum since yesterday for compatible battery.<br>\ncan i use a 3.7V li ion battery instead of LiFePO4? here in my place i could get the IFR battery but the suitable charger are very rare/hard to find/get, it seems to me that a li ion charger cannot be use for this battery since it charging v is 4.2V instead of 3.0v right?",Walt_Holm,"The ROV will run just fine using 3.7V batteries as opposed to 3.2V LiFePO4 batteries.  However, most of the 3.7V batteries that you find in size 26650 (they are generally an â€œNMCâ€ù chemistry- Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt) donâ€™t properly handle the current draw needed for the ROV.  The cell you pick needs to be able to handle a 10A discharge rate.There are a couple of different chargers available on the internet that will handle LiFePO4 batteries as well as lithium-ion.  But you are correct, a charger that was specifically made only for Li-ion should not be used for LiFePO4 batteries, as the charging voltage is too high.-W",kyril_acap,Couldnâ€™t find the chargers in any local online store. guess i will have to repurchase from Orov store for convenience,elizabeth.eliades,"Hi Kyril,Did you end up purchasing the Li ion batteries (3.7 V)? If so, how did they work for you? Which ROV model do you use?Thank you,Ellie",elizabeth.eliades,"Hi Walt,Are Li ion batteries okay to use in the 2.8 model instead of the LiFePO4? Looking for clarity about the NMC, did you mean that Li Ion batteries might be Li + NMC?<br>\nAlso, what is the tolerance of the stacked batteries in the 2.8 model as the design is intended? If I get batteries that are 67 mm long instead of 65.4 mm long, will it fit, or will I definitely have to remove some pieces inside the battery tube to fit?Thank you,Ellie",Walt_Holm,"Hi Ellie:You can use Li-NMC batteries in your OpenROV, but that comment comes with a lot of caveats.  Weâ€™ve only found one cell that works properly, and <a href=""http://store.openrov.com/collections/accessories/products/rechargeable-high-cap-li-nimnco-batteries-6x"">we sell them in our store now</a>.  The cells need to be able to source 10 amps continuously.  Most 26650-size Li-NMC cells are only rated for about 5 amps or so, and if they have a protection circuit, they will cut out at this point.  The problem is, under hard acceleration or deceleration, the ROV will need much more current than this, and the protection circuitry will cut out the battery pack.If your cells are 67mm long, they probably have a protection circuit on the cells.  Youâ€™ll need to test them to see if they can provide at least 10 amps or so without the protection circuit cutting out.<br>\nAs for 67mm long cells fitting properly, I think with some modifications youâ€™ll be able to get it to work, though I donâ€™t beleive anybody at OpenROV has tried this.  You could eliminate the 3mm plastic disc that holds the front battery tube electrode, and this would take care of most of the difference in length.

My test of 1/4"" rope suggested it was more than sufficient, but the rope I actually bought was less buoyant and the rope sinks slowly. It is still better though.

I have had zero problems with it thus far.I suspect they have conductive oil on them which would keep them from corroding in the slip mechanism.

pdw2732,"Hello everyone,You guessed it, Iâ€™m a newb. Iâ€™m looking to get my feet wet building an ROV.

Absolutely no protection from the water.  <img  title="":fearful:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":fearful:""> Thatâ€™s correct?The outrunner brushless motors can only be used in this way because it uses magentic force to spin the shaft â€_ inrunner motors not so much?

Itâ€™s that good? That correct?Thanks, everyone!",TCIII,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/pdw2732"">@pdw2732</a>,<br>\nShort answer: yes brushless motors will work in both fresh and salt water though their life expectancy will depend on the time spent in the water and the amount of maintenance (pressurized air flushing and lubrication) performed after each dive.<br>\nThe 2 ton epoxy used to seal the cable pass through and other End Cap cavities is more than adequate for sealing the WTC from the water environment. I was able to maintain a 540 mm Hg vacuum on the WTC for over an hour without any leakage.<br>\nAs far as the vent goes, it is there to release the air pressure in the WTC when inserting the End Caps which will compress the air in the WTC. That being said, the remaining air pressure in the WTC will increase as the Controller Board heats the air in the WTC which could possibly force the plug from the vent, but I have not seen that happen. The water surrounding the WTC will help to absorb the heat being generated by the Controller Board. Though OROV is recommending that the Controller Board with the new HD Pro Camera be run for 10 minutes or so with the vent plug removed prior to diving to help relieve the buildup of excessive pressure in the WTC.<br>\nYou might want to take a look at my <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/blue-robotics-openrov-2-8-hybrid-rov/4727"">Hybrid ROV</a> that uses BR T100 thrusters with an OROV WTC/2.8 Controller Board.<br>\nHope this helps.<br>\nRegards,<br>\nTCIII AVD",pdw2732,"Thanks a ton for taking the time (and detail) to respond!

badevguru,"I got this question from one of the teams working on ROS integration, but I figured I would share the approach with anyone interested:There is no raw mag/acc data at the moment.

Walt_Holm,"Here are some photos and details of a controller board that I just modified for Kevin K to support vectored-thrust on his ROV.  As some of you know, heâ€™s building an open-frame ROV (similar to those made by Outland), and has had a running forum post about it for some time:Though heâ€™s currently working with three thrusters, the design really begs to have a full complement of six thrusters for vectored-thrust operation. That is, two forward thrusters, two aft thrusters, and two vertical thrusters.  The fore and aft thrusters are placed at an angle to allow sideways (strafing) motion.  The two vertical thrusters enhance the lifting capability of the vehicle, and cancel out torques caused by using a single vertical thruster.Kevin had the foresight to pot a bunch of extra wires into his endcaps to support future expansion, soâ€_it was time to get to work on implementation.This spring I experimented with an OpenROV modified into a 4-thruster â€œvertransâ€ù configuration to allow it to move laterally.

I drill out the spare ESC output pads to allow the output wires from the 3 new ESCs to go to the bottom of the board.  2 of the ESCs (6 wires total) are routed this way, and connect to the 6 spare leads on the DB-25 connector:<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/4/4a813ddaed6454cc4fc678b4e028560d766aa924.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/4a813ddaed6454cc4fc678b4e028560d766aa924"" title=""6ESC Controller -3.jpg""><img  width=""690"" height=""388""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">6ESC Controller -3.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">3264x1836 280 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div> I avoided using the existing test pads TP20-TP25 since the traces attached to those pads are not designed for ESC currents.As the DB-25 connector now has all its wires used, the third extra ESC, as well as any external lights or external servo channels, will need to use and additional connector.Here is how I have the ESCs connected:Existing servo connections:<br>\nD6 - rear port thruster<br>\nD7 - vertical thruster - with Y-cable to drive both vertical ESCs<br>\nD8 - rear starboard thrusterNew servo connections:<br>\nD9- forward port thruster<br>\nD10 - forward starboard thrusterThe D11 channel is still used for the camera tilt.The ESC output pins are wired as follows:DB-25 pins 20-22:  port forward thruster<br>\nDB-25 pins 23-25:  second vertical thruster<br>\nFree wires, to be added to an additional connector:  starboard forward thrusterA couple of additional notes:The AFRO12 ESCs can be purchased from HobbyKing, but note that they need to be reprogrammed to provide forward/reverse behavior (they come shipped working in forwards only).  There is a script in the OpenROV software to do this (search the forums- the issue has come up before)- just plug the 3 new ESCs into D6,D7, and D8 temporarily, run the script, then plug all the ESCs back into their desired servo channels.Note that this is not a long-term solution for big vectored-thrust vehicles.  The total power-handling capability of the controller board has not changed, so in reality the power capability of each thruster has been cut in half.  But what it will allow Kevin to do is to test the vectored-thrust software and mechanical layout, while working on a long-term solution for the power supply (probably using ESCs built-in to the Blue thrusters)Hope this helps people with ideas for their own ROVs.  Let us know if any of you do something similar!-Walt",Kevin_K,"Big thanks to <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/walt_holm"">@Walt_Holm</a>, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/badevguru"">@badevguru</a> and <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/eric_stackpole"">@Eric_Stackpole</a> for the help and support on this one!Walt is exactly right, this is not a long term solution, but it is the path to larger vectored thrust ROVâ€™s where the power is scaled up proportionally. The 6 vectored thrust combination is the epitome of ROV design and any further thruster additions are simply adding more power to a given axis. This 6 thruster combination allows for stability in the vertical axis with the counter-rotating thrusters, the ability to strafe (constant heading but with lateral motion), and better yaw control.<br>\n<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/5/5fd7ea4fa2cf1a6009f0faf8857ecbdf182a7e55.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/5fd7ea4fa2cf1a6009f0faf8857ecbdf182a7e55"" title=""Seabotix LBV300.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""638"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Seabotix LBV300.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">640x501 59.3 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><br>\nSeabotix vLBV300Although we wonâ€™t be getting into advanced power systems for awhile, this is still an excellent opportunity to get the controls set-up and working.

So if youâ€™re going to use those auxiliary pins for ESCs, you need to disconnect the external lights and external servo channel.Iâ€™d get the 2.8 schematic off of our GitHub site for reference.  You need to desolder R73 and R74 (located on Sheet 6 of the schematic) and R70, R71, R72 (located on Sheet 2 of the schematic).  These resistors are under the pre-mounted ESCs, so you might have to partially unmount the ESCs to do this.Hope this helps.-W",Jim_Scholz,"Kevin, I am working on my first ROV now and wondered how your 6 thruster unit worked out?

The vast majority of robotics libraries, research algorithms, and sensor interfaces are natively written in C or C++, and you will probably find that the typical users of these software packages are not familiar with web technologies or communication frameworks. With that in mind, I would say that if you want to make the OpenROV more â€œopenâ€ù in the existing ecosystem of robotics software, you may want to consider choosing a more interoperable communication framework. For the purpose of trying to integrate an OpenROV vehicle into the research Iâ€™m doing at work, the roadblocks and cost/benefit impacts of not being able to easily interface with the OpenROV software with our existing software drive the decision to just use our own software for both communicating with and controlling the vehicle and enabling autonomous operation.In the meanwhile, Iâ€™ll keep my eyes peeled for other methods, libraries, etc to try and bridge this gap.-Charles",spiderkeys,"Incidentally, I have found a rather up to date DDS&lt;-&gt;NodeJS bridge that was developed by RTI, called â€œRTIConnectorâ€ù.

So this is probably as good a test case as any on accessing the ROV APIs given that reality.Technically you can connect to a <a href=""http://socket.io"">socket.io</a> service with any websocket client.

The BEC on each ESC is specâ€™d to source 0.5A at 5V, so you should be able to get 1.5A of current to the servo.  The servo you picked has a stall current of 1.8A at 6V, so it should be somewhat lower at 5V (see the spec sheet for the servo).

winnonad,"I have a Thunder Tiger Neptune that I build nearly 10 years  ago and equipped with a composite video camera and a surface float to transmit 90 MHz back to shore.<a href=""http://www.diannebest.com/Projects/Sub/Submarine.html"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.diannebest.com/Projects/Sub/Submarine.html</a>Technology  has advanced considerably so I am in the process of replacing the composite video camera with a 5MP digital camera with USB interface and a 2.4/5GHz link back to shore.A couple of shortcomings in the original system were lack of directional and depth information. When the sub has been submerged for awhile, I would  loose awareness of which direction it is moving and what depth I am at.Since I already have  the composite video camera and 900MHz link, I thought I would relocate the camera and have it focused on a miniature compass and differential pressure gauge to send the situational information to shore and display it on a separate video screen (since I donâ€™t want that information imposed on the high-resolution video). There isnâ€™t much space in the hull of the Neptune but enough for  a compass. The problem is the differential pressure gauge - I canâ€™t find one smaller than 2"" diameter.I ran across the IMU/Compass/Depth module on Open ROV but the literature says it uses absolute pressure measurement. To get an accurate depth indication, the actual depth would be absolute pressure minus surface pressure. Am  I missing something here???The module also provides a data output that is not directly displayable or transmittable on the 900MHz composite video link and  I donâ€™t have enough space within the hull to add much more in electronics.Does anybody have any ideas on an alternative?Thanks for listening and for any suggestions.",Walt_Holm,"For the depth gauge, you can use an absolute pressure sensor, and then subtract off a bias (zero the output) before the dive.  IIRC, in the OpenROV software we automatically subtract out a bias based upon the mean atmospheric pressure.  That way, if you forget to zero things, your depth reading is pretty close to the true depth.  When you are diving in the mountiains (such as in Lake Tahoe), you have the ability to zero things pre-dive and still get an accurate depth reading.If you are upgrading your system to a digital camera with a USB interface, why are you trying to put the digital depth on the old composite video?  It can be done, but not without some hassle.  Why do this for a system youâ€™re about to replace?-W",winnonad,"Good point. I had arrived at the same conclusion in a round-about way when I couldnâ€™t find a suitable analogue differential pressure gauge.Since I have broadband USB, I might as well move the telemetry to the USB link. I  can get compass chips and pressure transducers, digitize the signal, and pick them up at the other end of the serial stream.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ThomasE,"Hello OpenROV forum.Weâ€™re a group of students who have currently just finished building the OpenROV 2.8 and are ready to implement our control solution for it. The plan is to create our own heading and depth control using Modern control theory, more specifically a State-Space controller using an estimator.The current idea is that we want to write our own code on the beaglebone to incooperate our own system. We plan on re-using the code on the Arduino and are therefore currently looking for the commands which the nodejs server sends to the Arduino over serial. For the sake of simplicity and lack of time, we would prefer to implement said control system directly in cpp.We have figured out that the files such CThrusters_2X1.cpp checks whether the given command is equal to a string followed by some values (Over serial). And that there are several files managing the incoming commands, but no documentation regarding the available commands.Question is: Is there a compiled list somewhere of commands and their associated value ranges?",badevguru,"We have not built up documentation on the serial commands yet.  You can search the project openrov-cockpit project for <code>mcu.SendCommand</code> and you will find most of the commands that are sent.The only catch to this, is that we currently CRC the command that is sent:Commands are all in the format â€œ[CRC]Command(parameters);â€ùMost commands are sending floats between -1 to 1 or 0 to 1.  Given the limitation around sending floats through the current serial protocol, we have ben multiplying the floats by a large value to turn them in to a int and then reversing it back on the Arduino.Example:<br>\n<aside class=""onebox githubblob"">\n  <header class=""source"">\n      <a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-cockpit/blob/master/src/plugins/thrusters2x1/index.js#L30-L33"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">github.com</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=""onebox-body"">\n    <h4><a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-cockpit/blob/master/src/plugins/thrusters2x1/index.js#L30-L33"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">OpenROV/openrov-cockpit/blob/master/src/plugins/thrusters2x1/index.js#L30-L33</a></h4>\n<pre class=""onebox""><code class=""lang-js""><ol class=""start lines"" start=""30"" style=""counter-reset: li-counter 29 ;"">\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>thrusters2x1.prototype.SendMotorSettings = function SendMotorSettings() {</li>\n<li>if (!this.settings){return;}</li>\n<li>var settings = this.settings;</li>\n</ol></code></pre>\n\n\n  </article>\n  <div class=""onebox-metadata"">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style=""clear: both""></div>\n</aside>\n<br>\n<aside class=""onebox githubblob"">\n  <header class=""source"">\n      <a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software-arduino/blob/master/sketches/OpenROV2x/CThrusters_2X1.cpp#L71-L76"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">github.com</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=""onebox-body"">\n    <h4><a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software-arduino/blob/master/sketches/OpenROV2x/CThrusters_2X1.cpp#L71-L76"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">OpenROV/openrov-software-arduino/blob/master/sketches/OpenROV2x/CThrusters_2X1.cpp#L71-L76</a></h4>\n<pre class=""onebox""><code class=""lang-cpp""><ol class=""start lines"" start=""71"" style=""counter-reset: li-counter 70 ;"">\n<li>void CThrusters::Update( CCommand&amp; command )</li>\n<li>{</li>\n<li>if( command.Equals( ""mtrmod1"" ) )</li>\n<li>{</li>\n<li>    port_motor.m_positiveModifier = command.m_arguments[1] / 100;</li>\n<li>    vertical_motor.m_positiveModifier = command.m_arguments[2] / 100;</li>\n</ol></code></pre>\n\n\n  </article>\n  <div class=""onebox-metadata"">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style=""clear: both""></div>\n</aside>\n",ThomasE,"Thank you very much for your reply!

I know of an electrochemical technique that might be ideal based on United States Patent US9371243.  If you want the patentese translated to English I can help.",andy.o,"Thatâ€™s a really good point. I see there are some mechanical solutions like wiping the lens with a brush, but it adds complexity. Also there are antifouling paints, but I have doubts that they will protect the lens for weeks or months. Another solution is ultrasonic technology. I think I will just try some kind of coating first and I will see how long it will do the job. This year, there are new scientific publications about surfaces that prevent marine growth. I think itâ€™s just the matter of time till better products enter the market. First, I need to focus on crossing the ocean and forget the fancy stuff that consumes more than 10 mA on average. The camera itself consumes only 5 mA on average.",Douglas_Butler,"Our electrochemical process typically takes about 100mA for 10 minutes once a day.  An average of under 1mA.  It can also be shut off if not needed and boosted higher if conditions get severe, all under software control.  In a very small nutshell, if you put electricity through seawater with proper electrodes you can get hydrogen and chlorine at the electrodes.  With proper geometry the chlorine can be used to keep the lens clean.  There are no residual toxins and the dosing can be timed for the convenience of the host.",andy.o,"Thanks, that sounds promising! It reminds me making hydrogen almost every day when I was a child and the chlorine was a nasty byproduct. Pretty confident with this solution, I am definitely going to try it.",andy.o,"I have found a research paper which is older than the patent:<br>\n<a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7031344_Development_of_an_electrochemical_antifouling_system_for_seawater_cooling_pipelines_of_power_plants_using_titanium"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7031344_Development_of_an_electrochemical_antifouling_system_for_seawater_cooling_pipelines_of_power_plants_using_titanium</a>What is the difference between this and the 1st patent claim?",Douglas_Butler,"It is interesting how that paper differs from our method Theirs:â€œUsing titanium as the electrode material, chlorine and hypochlorite are not generated.â€ù while we use a titanium substrate with a multi layer oxide finish to promote chlorine generation as opposed to oxygen, calcium, manganese, and a variety of other components of seawater.A lot of people have tried to use electrolysis to stop biofouling in the past.  The bulk of our work has been in avoiding unwanted electrolysis byproducts, controlling the dispersal of the chlorine both as free gas and as hypochlorous acid film, and correlating the electrolysis with the biofilm life cycle.  All of these help to reduce the electrical power requirements and extend electrode life.",Stretch,"Do you have any idea how fast your craft will be traveling?  If it is moving fast enough, fouling may not be as big an issue as you think.  â€œAblativeâ€ù anti-fouling paint can be used that will â€œself polishâ€ù as the boat is sailing.  Otherwise, if your craft is moving slowly, fouling could become an issue.Iâ€™ve crossed oceans on racing sailboats that had a â€œkelp windowâ€ù, a small plexiglass window in the hull that allowed you to look at the keel while underway.  You also may not see as much wildlife as you are probably hoping to see.  Once youâ€™ve left the coast, the oceans largely seem like a vast â€œdesertâ€ù of salt water.  Every once in a while weâ€™d have dolphins and pilot whales playing in our bow wake, or squid attracted to our deck lights at night, but other than that, we rarely saw any marine animals of any sort while mid ocean.",andy.o,"The speed depends much on the weather conditions. Itâ€™s hard to estimate before I actually build the boat. I guess that I wonâ€™t see much, but itâ€™s worth trying. I will record a 20-40-hour video and then I will let a software recognize any moving objects. When you are sailing, I assume you are not constantly focused on the underwater life for many hours. In the future, I would add an ultrasonic sensor or a low-power camera and it will start recording whenever something moves in front of the camera. This way, I can record every moving object during a three month journey.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

zacmacc,"Hello,Iâ€™m currently working on characterizing the dynamics of the OpenROV 2.7 and thought you guys would find these results interesting.I have found the locations and magnitudes of the centre of mass and centre of buoyancy in my model using CAD. The centre of mass was found by incorperating the relevant weights and densities of all components into the model; and the centre of buoyancy through finding the centroid of the submerged volume. The magnitude of mass is the weight and the magnitude of buoyancy is the mass of displaced water.In my model, I measured the mass as 2519g and the estimated total weight from CAD is 2513g, this agreement gives confidence in the results. The calculated buoyancy force is 24.47 N whereas the weight is 24.71 N. So in this case, the ROV is slightly heavier than water though in cases where water is denser (saliter, colder) it may be neutrally buoyant or positively buoyant.In equilibrium state the centre of mass lies below the centre of buoyancy. The intensity with which the ROV returns to its equilibrium from a disturbance is dependant on the relative positions of the COM &amp; COG, the inertia properties of the body and also the drag characteristics. From this analysis the COM &amp; COG are seen to lie fairly close to one another meaning the restoring force is less than if they were further apart.Another interesting thing is that the thrusters axes coincide with the center of mass, which is ideal to prevent a moment about the COM while thrusting. Iâ€™m not sure if this was a design consideration or a coincidence, does anyone know?<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/c/ced5a5be3d6a9327cc82047a20798d9c2f25f819.PNG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/ced5a5be3d6a9327cc82047a20798d9c2f25f819"" title=""COM,COB,Thruster Axis.PNG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""690"" height=""379""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">COM,COB,Thruster Axis.PNG</span><span class=""informations"">754x415 18.6 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>",Roy_Petter_Dyrdahl_T,"For the COB calculation you used freshwater (1000 kg/m3), right?",zacmacc,"Hey Roy, yes indeed, 1000 kg/meter cubed for the buoyancy force - the location of the COB shouldnâ€™t chage for other densities, only the magnitude.",Fe3C,"Great work <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/zacmacc"">@zacmacc</a>!Interesting thought, that an enlargement of the vertical distance between the COM and COG would increase the ROVs stability. Did you have look at the horizontal distance between the two? From your image it looks like the ROV would be slightly pitched, which matches my experience from the field.When talking about the thruster axes in correlation with the COM, it needs to be considered that hydrodynamical drag has a significant influence on the stability while thrusting. Due to the asymmetrical layout my ROV 2.8 does a significant dive during thrusting. So it might be helpful, to move the COM a bit, so that the moment resulting from thrusting counteracts the hydrodynamical moment. I will take this into consideration when adjusting the final balance of my ROV. Thanks!",zacmacc,"Thanks <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/fe3c"">@Fe3C</a>. Yes, as you said I think this does explain the slight pitch that I have also noticed. The COM &amp; COG more or less lie on the vehicles plane of symmetry. Yes, very good point about the hydrodynamic drag and this is surely the main cause of moments while thrusting. As part of the dynamics characterization Iâ€™m currently also working on a CFD simulation, I intend to find the center of pressure for forwards motion. Regarding moving the center of gravity to counteract the pressure I think that this could bring some improvement, though, the drag force is a function of velocity so the effect would not be stable at all speeds. Perhaps through modifying the geometry with some sort of spoiler the center of pressure could be moved so itâ€™s also in line with the thrusters. If I have time I may play around with this and give some recommendations. It would be interesting if implementing this in reality would bring noticeable improvements to the stability of the vehicle.More to come soon!<img  width=""591"" height=""466"">",Roy_Petter_Dyrdahl_T,"That is correct as long as the ROV is fully submerged <img  title="":wink:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":wink:"">",Fe3C,"I would assume the moment caused by the thrust force is also indirectly a function of the speed, as the force needs to be higher for greater speeds. However, both the drag moment and the static moment from thrusting do not correlate linearly with the amount of thrust. So maybe the counteract each other for a bigger variety of speeds.However, in field I have only little problem with unstable pitch, as straight forward movement is only a small part of the entire exploration. And apparently all these problems have been tackled with the Trident (mostly likely due to its improved symmetry drag wise). So for explorers that prefer straight forward movement, they could use a Trident.Finally, I feel that ROV is very sensitive to only small changes in the water properties (salty, temperature etc.) that it is very hard to find the perfect configuration for a wide variety of applications.",e4andy,"Iâ€™ve been watching this thread with great interest. Iâ€™m afraid my exploration has not been good so far. I donâ€™t really understand the technicalities of it but I do know that it is almost impossible to steer the ROV in any sensible way.<br>\nMost of what we have been looking at is on the seabed. When you go forwards, it just dives and hits the bottom hard. When you go up it goes astern, when you go astern it goes up. When you turn, it doesnâ€™t really do much, presumably because thereâ€™s too much drag from the tether.<br>\nIâ€™m really getting quite despondent, it just seems to be pot luck what you actually see, thereâ€™s no way of steering towards something and stopping.<br>\nWe went out to dive on a serpulid reef nearby and it was just careering about all over the place. I have checked the thrusters and they are all working in the right way. What are we doing wrong?<br>\nAndrew",Fe3C,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/e4andy"">@e4andy</a>, what is your pitch angle without thrust? (Maybe use the IMU to determine the actual degree?) Is it a strong nose down pitch? The ROV does dive slightly with forward drag to due the above discussed hydrodynamical drag but it should not be so bad, that you can not avoid hitting the bottom. And when going slow this issues should not be that big of problem, especially with depth hold.When i use the smaller thruster settings (e.g. 1 or 2) i find the ROV to be very sensitive in steering, in all dimensions.You could try to do some balance work on your ROV, so reducing some of the weight at the front and attaching more to the back (to tackle the go-forward-and-dive issue), maybe also in field.",e4andy,"Hi Lukas, I will try adjusting the pitch. It is a little nose down but not much. If I have it on low settings it doesnâ€™t really move much, I have to use 3 or 4 to get any significant movement.

nicholas.goodman.1,"This my first time posting on this form. I am a active member of the DIY ROV community and have built many ROVs. I have knew about the OpenROV project for a long time now and think that it is a great concept. But with the release of there new ROV the price point has risen significantly and the ability to customize is low. My most recent ROV design consist of a modular design that allow you to assemble the ROV in any configuration similar to legos. With many modules like thruster, led, 2 axis camera, manipulator, etc. The price point for the ROV would be much lower then open ROV.

Knowing where the ROV is located at a given time t, and by sampling all accelerometers reâ€_Since you would always know where you are (in the boat), and the ROV can have an accelerometer,  gyro and magnetometerâ€“couldnâ€™t you simply keep track of its position? Obviously there is vector math to work out, but at the sample rate weâ€™re talking about here in terms of position updates, I wouldnâ€™t think the math would be that difficult. And it could be done on the laptop/PC, instead of the ROV. Even at that, something like the new quad-core Raspberry Pi could easily handle this math. In early tests with the RPi2 unit Iâ€™ve been developing for, sensor updates at even 20Hz only take about 50-75% of one processing coreâ€“and thatâ€™s with an X connection over tunneled SSH. So I canâ€™t imagine that it wouldnâ€™t be possible to do something like this, and certainly others must be working on it as well.But itâ€™s an interesting subject though, and one very worthwhile.TB",Kevin_K,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/scott_w"">@Scott_W</a> Funny, it was actually Domâ€™s retelling of that 40m wreck story with the ferries that had me seriously think about the surface GPS option.  I agree, this would be great to work with the boat, buoy, and ROV so you could see all three in relation to each other from above.I donâ€™t plan to get too far in the weeds on this one. Pretty much just a GPS streamer is all Iâ€™m imagining at this point, but as you mentioned, just getting the maps and positioning to work will lead into the other navigation systems.Ok now I see the concept behind an external antenna. Good point on the replacement factor. Thatâ€™ll probably happen in seawater.<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/badevguru"">@badevguru</a> Yes please!

Iâ€™ll figure out the hardware part.<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/tcbetka"">@tcbetka</a> I think an Inertial Navigation System (INS) is the way ahead for long range AUV/UUVs, but every INS system I know of still requires periodic GPS updates at the surface (yes, even submarines). We had the AN/WSN-7 on the surface ships I was on and for as good as they are, these still require GPS corrections. â€™INS does have the advantage that you donâ€™t need a baseline as an acoustic positioning system does. Both INS and acoustic positioning are still systems of estimation that need to be corrected. Your vehicle will be somewhere in a â€œcircle of errorâ€ù that gets larger as time progresses without correction.",tcbetka,"Oh, no doubt that there will be errorâ€“however the velocities weâ€™re talking about here are quite small, so the math requirements shouldnâ€™t be too terribly greatâ€_and the errors shouldnâ€™t be all that significant either.The one caveat in all this is drift. As in current. Depending upon how sensitive the IMU is, there will be a point where motion relative to the water current will be too subtle to detect, and then of course an accurate position calculation will no doubt suffer. So I definitely understand your point about the need for periodic GPS updates. But then again, in the examples you cited (submarines and surface ships), the average velocity those things traveled was many times greater than those of an ROVâ€“so the cumulative error would be greater as well, and thus the need for periodic updates be higher Iâ€™d think. That being said, their mass was obviously much greater as wellâ€“so they were not as affected by such things are current, wind and tidal activities. The length of a typical ROV mission would be such that error might not be as significant simply because it doesnâ€™t have as long to accumulate, for instance.But I do agree with your statements. I certainly have nowhere near the sort of experience as you do with long-term travel on a vessel, but I grew up fishing in small boats on rivers and large lakes, so I can certainly appreciate cumulative position error. Still though, it might not hurt for a person to bone up on calculus, dynamics (equations of motion) and linear algebra, and then go do a bit of work on this problem. And in fact Iâ€™m in the process of all of that now.In the end my ROV might still get lost, but at least Iâ€™ll be a (mathematically) educated moronâ€_and be able to tell you where it <strong><em>should</em></strong> be.LOL!TB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
allai,"Iâ€™ve noticed that in many professional ROVs, they tend to only have one degree of freedom (opening and closing) for claws.

Well, cost is one obvious one - each actuator costs money. Whether the data chaneels can support the multiple DoF is another issues in complexity rather than cost.

Both methods of mounting seem to work quite well, you see both done.Hopefully my morning speak makes since, <img  title="":sleeping:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":sleeping:""> <img  title="":blush:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":blush:"">-Carter",TCIII,"Hi Carter,My original ROV is a traditional design with 6 vectored thrusters 4 of which are horizontal and 2 of which are vertical mounted in a a rectangular frame made of HDPE. The 4 inch in diameter WTCs are mounted parallel to sides of the frame one on top of the other. The top WTC holds the navigation controller while the bottom WTC holds the LiPo batteries. The ROV required only 5 pounds of ballast to balance it fore and aft make it just slightly awash in the water.Depending on the cost of the laser cutting I might build this ROV with the WTC parallel to the sides like the OpenROV just to be different.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/2/22bc722045803cf471fd7a4d5f7cfd0de35c3939.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/22bc722045803cf471fd7a4d5f7cfd0de35c3939"" title=""ROV Chassis Awash 1.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">ROV Chassis Awash 1.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">800x600 56.2 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/d/d7c95c2b36739e87362e6ecb98873a8a2c3dcf50.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/d7c95c2b36739e87362e6ecb98873a8a2c3dcf50"" title=""ROV Top Resized.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">ROV Top Resized.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">1000x750 215 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>Regards,<br>\nTCIII AVD",carterhbond,"TCIII,To start off, your ROV looks great!I might agree with your idea to build the next ROV like the OpenROV styled design.

tgfeminella,"Hello! Iâ€™m attempting to rig a (hopefully) simple manipulator using a car door lock actuator (small geared dc motor). Theyâ€™re super cheap and plentiful, so I wonâ€™t be too heart broken if it doesnâ€™t last long underwater. I know my 2.8 has a 9V PWM channel available, but can it be used di-directionally? If not, I could use that PWM channel to power a potted brushed ESC, and then one of the servo channels to control it. Iâ€™d be wasting an output, but the plus would be that I could program it to cut power to the manipulator if its current draw exceeded 2A. I believe that pin A0 measures non-ESC current, correct?Alternately, is there a way that I could wire the brushed ESC inside the e-tube so that its output could be routed through the existing aux wires easily? Thank you in advance for your ideas!",Walt_Holm,"Hi There:You are right, the PWM channels are uni-directional.For your application, Iâ€™d do exactly as you suggested- use a brushed ESC, and attach it to a couple of the auxiliary outputs that are currently set for a servo output.  Youâ€™ll need to disconnect the D9 servo channel from aux ouputs  TP23-TP25 by removing jumpers R70-R72 â€“ see sheet 2 of the schematic.  You can drive the ESC by connecting it to the 3-pin connector for servo channel D9.  Then comes the fun of powering it- if you run it off of V_BAT, the current monitoring at this point is capped at 2 amps, as you say.  Probably better to try to pick off ESC_POWER at some point, since thatâ€™s designed for high currents.  See Sheet 3 of the schematic for more details.-W",tgfeminella,"Thanks for the advice, I ended up taking the spring loaded approach and just used the existing pwm setup. I modified the external lights plugin for axis control, then limited the output to 50%.

This causes the oil to leak out of the seals due to the expansion and it then allows water to get in.  Not sure if there is a way around this or not.

christianuhlenfeldt,"Hello everyone,Long time reader, first time poster here â€“ Iâ€™ve been trying to decide if I should get the 2.8 kit or wait for the Trident. I have zero experience with builds like this, so the out-of-the-box Trident is appealing, but on the other hand the ability to modify and add components seem a lot more limited.When researching these forums a bit, I wasnâ€™t able to find any information on the future plans for the DIY kits. Is the OpenROV team planning to keep developing these beyond Trident?Completely unrelated, I was also wondering if this Spanish store (<a href=""http://tienda.openrov.es/gb/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://tienda.openrov.es/gb/</a>) is an official partner of yours and if anyone have experience ordering from them?Thanks!Best wishes,<br>\n/Christian",Zack,"Hey Christian,Glad to field this question.This is really a tough call. I would definitely say get both if you can <img  title="":slightly_smiling:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slightly_smiling:""> but I understand that for most people that choice isnâ€™t always an option. I can help guide you (and hopefully others) in this.First I will talk about the 2.8 and the assembly. The 2.8 kit does require some tools and a little patience but the build is really fun and you will learn a lot. The instructions <a href=""http://openrov.dozuki.com/"">here</a> can give you an idea of what you are in for. The 2.8 and instruction set are based on a few years of development and tons of feedback and most people regardless of experience level can do it. I also manage the technical support team and I can safely say that we will back you up 100% of the way. Need some clarification? Weâ€™re on it. Screw something up? A new oneâ€™s in the mailâ€_itâ€™s their goal to make sure these ROVs get in the water.Okay, so the build isnâ€™t that badâ€_but should you wait for Trident? Good question.Letâ€™s start with timing. Trident wonâ€™t be ready for a while. Our Kickstarter has a November target that we are working towards as I write this. So if you need the capability right now, go with the 2.8.Second, what about building and hacking your way to success? Trident will also feature the ability to add and/or modify the software and hardwareâ€“weâ€™re obsessed with giving the community the option to make their own tools. To what extent and how soon some of these things are ready on Trident is still TBD, so if you have a strong need to get add-onâ€™s and hacks ready and working right away I think the 2.8 might be a better bet. The 2.8 has wires already outside the electronics tube for i2c, PWM, and servo channel. Also, this forum is full of folks who have already done their own mods and hacks.What about performance? The 2.8 is designed as an observation-class mini-ROV and as such performs really well in tight spaces with little current it has a moving camera platform to look up and down. The Trident on the other hand is much more suited for running search patterns and covering more area quickly. It will be fast, agile, and able to track in straight lines. Simply put, if you are interested in looking <em>for</em> something go with Trident, if you are interested in looking <em>at</em> something 2.8 may be a better option.Finally, if all above are good to know but donâ€™t really change your mind, youâ€™re probably left with one question: Is Trident going to be much better and therefore worth the wait? All other things above equal, yes, the Trident will be the best low-cost underwater exploration tool ever developed. You can pre-order it <a href=""https://shop.trycelery.com/page/5637ca44df92ea03009633b3"">here</a>.To your unrelated question about the Spanish store: yes, they are an Authorized OpenROV Reseller and are amazingly helpful and knowledgeable folks.In closing, If you or anybody else has any questions about this, post here and we can help clarify as best we can.

davy,"t it shaped like a real sub?"")",Jesse,"There are a couple of reasons.   Traditional submarines ( Like u-boats, nuclear subs, etc) have a much different purpose than ROVs.  Traditional submarines (subs) are usually used for long distance work.  This means that hydrodynamic efficiency is a primary design constraint.  Because they have a long distance to go, the most efficient design saves fuel, which allows a longer travel distance.  As well, the cylindrical shape has some properties which help with strength.With a long cylindrical shape designed for speed and distance, manuverability takes a hit.  ROVs are usually used to view or manipulate something, which requires a high degree of manuverability.",Ion,"Jesse, fully agreed.Davy:Beside everything explained by Jesse, there is also a dimensions problem.The ""ideal"" undewater vehicle, has an ellipsoidal bow and a pseudo-parabolloidal stern section. Main proportion is 1/7, meaning that total lenght is seven times maximum beam.A so shaped ROV, would have, quite big construction difficulties, that are not worth for a ROV normal use, beside a big amount of wasted volume and possitive flotation issues.Anyway, hydrodynamics cannot be neglected, and Im with you in the sence that can be improved.I must point that holding key qualities(simplicity, manouverability, versatility, low costs ...) while improving hydrodynamics, is not an easy matter.Regards",HR1,"I would think a sphere would be ideal.

I was seeing this as a dumbed down version of SLAM but most likely more than enough for what we are doingAn interesting ideaâ€_ Iâ€™ve recently started a Ph.D. in SLAM for underwater robots, using the OpenROV as my platform. My initial idea was to create a virtual model of the OpenROV complete with a realistic seabed model so that I could try to implement a SLAM algorithm virtually before trying to do it on the robot itself, though this felt too risky as I think the technology (especially in the underwater domain) is young and the challanges for a complete SLAM implementation are significant (processing, feature recognition, turbidity, currents, motion modelling etc.). So as a focus for my project Iâ€™ve decided to look at trying to compensating for the effect of currents within the SLAM framework. Part of this will involve creating a simulation and I hope to make it availiable to the community and play around with it myself in the future so that we can start make some steps towards high level control and autonomy.Do you know if anyone has tried to implement dead reckoning via an inertial navigation system (INS)? This should be fairly straight forward though Iâ€™m not sure how accurate it would be given the quality of the IMU. Perhaps a pragmatic approach to start would be to try to build a mosaik using the readings from the INS.",Jim_N,Indeed. Iâ€™ll respond more fully tonight. Thereâ€™s always been I interest but I think thereâ€™s more if a desire and need now then before.

Depending on what you want to accomplish, in the monocular sense, there exist three big playersâ€_but Iâ€™m not an expert, so I may be missing some.Iâ€™ve spent the last few months at 5% of my time per week looking at SVO and PTAM. Yes not much time, thatâ€™s why itâ€™s taking me forever <img  title="":smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":smile:""> Anyway, SVO and PTAM work well for aerial systems both indoors and outdoors. Currently in the process of evaluating outdoorsâ€_takes a bit since itâ€™s a failry unconstrained environment so quantifying all the variables for accurate testing is arduous to say the least. However, indoors is another matter. Anyway, not to bore you with the details, SVO comes in at about ~cm accuracy with camera only, while PTAM lies somewhere in the 1.5+ m range, and drifts a bit, with camera only. (i.e. no fused IMU and barometer/altimeter data) for solving the camera resectioning problem, or localization of the camera in the world frame. LSD-SLAM is next on the listâ€_maybe after the holidays, late January Iâ€™ll have a good idea of how it performs.Anyway, SVO is great as long as your downward facing. The out of the box algorithm keyframe method is tuned for that camera orientation. Also, it doesnâ€™t build much of a map, nor was it designed to. PTAM, on the other hand, builds a sparse map and when fused with IMU and altitude data, comes in at around 1/2 m accuracy (granted using cheapo IMUs). Itâ€™s also important to note that both of these methods break and drift off, often and need tuning given  environmental differences. No solution exists that can run out of the box and be stable, reliable, and spot onâ€_yet.Continuing, read the papers, they are good, and they claim great results, hopefully we can get close to them on our systems and in real deployments. We shall see.In regards to ROV/AUVs, <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/zacmacc"">@zacmacc</a>, yes. LOL. That is fantastic. All of your points about why it seems difficult is why it is difficult and there has been a great deal of money thrown at this problem in the DOD world and they have their solutions, donâ€™t know what they are, but I donâ€™t think they are that good, so youâ€™re tackling a good problem space. I can say that noise from the motors will adversely affect your IMU. The big dogs, covert subs and million dollar ROVs, have really expensive and accurate INS. On our kits, the motor noise and quality of the cell phone IMU is going to give you head aches galore. They do me on a weekly basis and others on this forum.But letâ€™s keep this thread alive. Weâ€™ve been talking about this for at least a year and havenâ€™t made any progress for marine work to date, nows a good a time as any to actually do work, lol.Just a comment about SfM and Localization, though solving what seems to be the same problem is not really. Doing SLAM, you need real-time or near real-time. Given that the ROVs are mostly slow things, near real-time is fine. Processing on a topside buoy is brilliant, do it! Even the RPi2 has problems with denser point cloud workâ€_like it canâ€™t really handle large points clouds for SLAM work. We use an odroid xu4 for svo and ptam and it does a good job, but we do not map densley nor are building large maps on themâ€_donâ€™t think iâ€™ll even attempt it yet.Anyway, could talk for years about this subject. Hereâ€™s the rig I have,Using an RPi2 with a Navio+ Autopilot cape running ROS. I plan on a bluefox global shutter camera (absolutely needed for VO/SLAM workâ€_we can argue about this later) but now just a simple c920 webcam for preliminary feature testing. The bluefox is somewhat pricey so I have to play nice with others in order to use it for my testing. Gutted my ROV for the acrylic housing (have a new pressure housing ordered from blue robotics) and using a similar homeplug network setup for the comms to topside.

joefromireland,"Any ideas on a ROV designed for the search and recovery of missing persons underwater in varying visibility. What I had in mind was a modular system where you could   join up 2 or more rovâ€™s with a pole that could adjusted to vary in length. All  modules would be controlled by a master unit with 1 or more slave units that could be joined together to form a horizontal  pole which could vary the spacing between the cameras depending on the visibility of the water .So say the visibility is poor and the largest distance you can stay from the bottom is 4 foot before you get a image of poor quality  then with a 3 module set up you would be able to cover approx.( 3 x 4) 12  foot of a span while searching in poor visibility , now say the visibility is not so bad say 10 foot then you could extent the spacing between each cameras to 10 foot  giving approx. 30 foot of coverage with 3 cameras all controlled by the one controller.<br>\nso if you were using the 3 module unit it could have 3 forward facing cameras and possibly a camera at 45 degrees at each end to get a bit more distance, these figures are approx and the idea is in the early stages but it may also be required to power the unit from the boat as extended searching would not be unusual when looking for the recovery of bodyâ€™s, what is required is a ROV that can be adjusted out of the water to vary its length so as to get the maximum amount of search area for a given visibility and number of cameras and to cover a large area as quickly",Scott_W,"Have a look at what <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/stretch"">@Stretch</a> is doing<br>\n<aside class=""quote"" data-post=""1"" data-topic=""3207"">\n  <div class=""title"">\n    <div class=""quote-controls""></div>\n    <img alt="""" width=""20"" height=""20""  class=""avatar"">\n    <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/garmin-panoptix-affordable-rov-mounted-multi-beam-sonar/3207?source_topic_id=3294"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Garmin Panoptix - Affordable ROV mounted multi-beam sonar?</a> <a class=""badge-wrapper  bullet"" href=""/c/off-topic""><span class=""badge-category-bg"" style=""background-color: #AB9364;""></span><span class=""badge-category clear-badge"" title=""This is the place for everything ROV, OpenROV, or shared exploration related that doesnâ€™t fit into the rest of the categories."">General Discussion</span></a>\n  </div>\n  <blockquote>\n    Just finished my first tests of the Garmin Panoptix Sonar.

There are a few towed systems, but the ROV mounted ones are few and far between. You might want to try attaching one of the recreational side scan units (Garmin, Lowrance, Humminbird) to an ROV and see where that gets you.",joefromireland,"Thanks for the replys so far and I am hoping for more help and ideas.<br>\nMy interest is mostly in search and recovery applications so I am looking for the most efficient way of searching when speed of recovery is important .<br>\nThere are many advantages to sonar but also many disadvantages when searching for bodies or anything lost underwater.<br>\nSome of the disadvantage of sonar are.<br>\n1 False positive signals signals that look like what your looking for but turn out to be something totally different.<br>\n2 Definition is still poor compared to a camera.<br>\n3 It can be very difficult to interpret the images  you can go over the same object  several times from slightly different angles or from a different height with a sidescan sonar  and each time you can get a different image, some images can look totally different to what the object is.<br>\n4 When you get a image or number of images  on sonar you have then have to get back to the exact location often in poor visibility to send  a diver to check out the image, when you get a image with a ROV you can move closer and get a detailed picture from every angle and be pretty sure you are on the right track before you send a diver down.What I had in mind is a modular system ,probably 3 slightly modified ROVâ€™s that would connect together but would be controllable with one controller and would be ideally recharged from the surface with a buoy on top that would provide GPS data and remote charging that would give unlimited battery life or at least extended bottom time as long as there was power on the top side.This set up would consist of two or more ROVâ€™s ,these would be almost standard ROV;s except they would have a input and a output port this would allow them to be configured for normal use or as a slave unit where they would take directions from a master unit which would have the tether to the surface while the slaves would have a shortened tether that would plug into the ROV designated as the master ,the slave units could at any time have the normal tether plugged in and they would be used as normal units.Each ROV would attach to a harness that could adjust the space between each ROV depending on the visibility from perhaps as little as 3 feet to perhaps more than 15 feet between each ROV, so for a 3 unit set up would be 30 ft long giving perhaps a sweep of 45 feet at the bottom, the software would be slight different than normal as would need to be able to left and right hand vertical thrusters.For me battery life of 3 hours is to short as if you after spending a lot of time getting ready for a day of searching to be limited to 3 hours of searching is just to short especially if you are involved in search and recovery  and you can have other volunteers to take over the running of the ROV while you take a <a href=""http://break.As"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">break.As</a> you would be controlling perhaps 3 ROVâ€™s and perhaps charging them by the tether you could have a slightly heaver tether that would allow for more current to carried by the wires down to the ROV.",craig_bates,"Joe,<br>\nYou may want to take an avenue similar to what I am working on.

B9W,"Iâ€™m wanting to add a few sensors/ features (for fun and experimentation) and have them display information on the cockpit.  I canâ€™t say Iâ€™m the best at writing code but am most definitely not a noob.  I know arduino (C++) really well and Python (but single thread only).  I have played with HTML and java enough to know how they work and tweek them if needed.  My problem is the openROV source is so broken up Iâ€™m having a hard time figuring out where everything goes or is located.  I want to be very clear in saying im not complaining in any way as it is a beautiful piece of work.  Iâ€™m just not man enought tackel it.  I have seen a few totorials but they never actually adjust the code just say look here or here and never from start to finish. Maybe Iâ€™m not finding the right ones though.For instance if I want to add a temp probe (external) . Is there a tutorial to walking me though where all the areas i will have to manipulate the code are, and areas to be careful about?  I have found a few but I still feel like Iâ€™m missing something.If not I would gladly pay someone to hold a webinar with me where they code in a potentiometer and have it display in the cockpit.

It appears to be a very safe way to do some pressure testing but I wanted to know if anyone had actual experience?Thanks,william_alexander,"I havenâ€™t tried using one of these paint pressure vessels although like that they have a large opening. I have been using an old pool filter housing that I got of the side of the road and pressurising it using the water pressure out of my hose (60 psi). Pool filters typically come with a bleed valve at the top allowing you to remove all air, significantly reducing any safety risks.",Teaguey,I have been doing serious pressure testing of cable feedthroughs but i wouldnâ€™t have though it was overly cheap as Iâ€™m at a university and have access to a custom RIG that i can simulate 2.5km (250 bar). Its essentially a piston that you wind back to draw water in then wind in to apply pressure. William is right make sure there is no air in the device and if you are simulating high pressure ensure that the thing is properly secured with bolts and again on high pressure place something like sand bags over the bolts as they can snap and are basically bullets.,william_alexander,"I thought Iâ€™d add a comment to show the importance of pressure testing. I happened to be doing final testing on the cable penetrators on my main hull last night and ended up with a catastrophic failure. Very disappointing but am happy nothing of value was inside.

This was most likely due to a washer sticking out resulting in a point load as well as poor quality acrylic tube.The cable penetrators (or feedthroughs) are fine. For these I have drilled out the centre of 316 stainless bolts and then epoxy the cables in using marine epoxy. To seal the bolt against the end cap (which is an acetal disc) I use a silicone gasket sealant designed for water pumps. This way if I really want to I can remove a cable.I have 2 sealed vessels in my ROV design using the same methods and materials. The other tube handled the pressure fine.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no technical information available from Graupner, hence Iâ€™ve been searching for the most suitable standards and found that those props almost fit with the <strong>Gawn Burril</strong> standard series.<br>\nThe Gawn series polynomials (4 quadrants) can be easily found in the net as free downloads.Hence the polynomial expresions can be used for modeling the propellers performance (Velocity/Thrust/Torque/efficiency/RPM).<br>\nAs Colin says, the flow characteristics for the ROV are very different from that in Open-Water conditions. But it can be reasonably solved by calculating the wake factor for the ROV.<br>\nThe suitable propeller is:<br>\n<strong>R=65: P/D=0.49: AeAo=0.4</strong> NOTE: Correction for Reynolds number required, when needed.The device design is not â€œflow-friendlyâ€ù, hence the flow is quite messy. The incoming flow to the propeller discs is really untidy, and then, the propulsive efficiency very, very much reduced.<br>\nAbout the wake factor, Iâ€™ve done several calculations and a number of attempts for modeling it. If you want, I can share my results.<br>\nRegarding the dynamic behaviour of the whole ROV under work. The RAOs are the first thing to be calculated. For foating objects the starting point is the sea waves spectrum. But for underwater vehicles, when the wave effect can be neglected, the starting point are the driving, interference and hydrodynamic forces.<br>\nOnce those forces are duly known, and from the Response Amplitude Operators the motion of a body with 6DOF can be modeled.<br>\nThats not an easy thing, as all factors change when the forces balance changes. Hence a statistical model must be built allowing for the use of only a fixed number of â€œconstantâ€ù RAOs.<br>\nThere are in the market a number of programs that allow for the RAOs computation. From MaxSurf that uses statistical models, to Numeca FineMarine that computes them from the Navier Stokes equations, soving complex and accurate CFD simulations.<br>\nAs the ROV is already built, my advice is to use a statistical model computed from real â€œsea trialsâ€ù. As the speed range is very short, and sea conditions can be completly neglected,  from only 6 RAOs (Pitch,Roll,Yaw and linear motions along X,Y,Z)  the motions can be duly modeled.Regards",kschwantje,"I ran into a couple of ROV simulators which might be of interest.

TCIII,"Hi All,<br>\nSince I am assembling a number of OpenROV WTCs and their accompanying End Caps I thought that I would pass along how I built a couple of alignment tools to align the 10th, 11th, and 12th acrylic plates, with the 20 mm center holes, to the ~10 mm hole in the 9th acrylic plate.<br>\nI used a quality fly cutter equipped with a 1/4 in diameter drill to cut out a 20 mm disk in a 1/4 in thick piece of HDPE.<br>\nI used the fly cutter to cutout the 20 mm disk from both sides of the 1/4 in thick HDPE, but did not cut though enough on the other side to free the disk from the HDPE.

The advantages are higher bandwidth, lower density (closer to neutrally boyant), longer range, and the possibility for it to be extreamly thin and degrade naturally if lost underwater.  The overwhelming disadvantage was finding a practical devise that could convert between fiber and a common electrical protocol (such as Ethernet or USB). Such devises do exist, but are generally large and expensive.  The other issue is that re-terminating damaged tether would be very hard.. in fact, nearly impossible, and the tether would be very fragile.

Took it up and noticed some fog on the inside, i thought it might be ok with a second dive. I should have put in some dessiccant, but have not been able to get hold of any. Anyway, second dive went really well, we had the anchor exactly on a wreck site and descended with a loose plastic band around the anchor line as vertical guidance. When we have reached the bottom, i put in full speed back and succeded in ripping the plastic band to get free from the anchor line, just as planned. Then suddenly the screen went black, we tried restarting both browser and rov, to no avail.

I remember we tested about 50 tubes by putting one end in a tupperware with water (that covered the endcap) at a time. We could then narrow it down to which endcap. Then we could watch carefully and see if was the main o-ring or the epoxy pass through, or even the laminatesâ€_tough to catch.Often times there is water in the tube after a deep dive in cold water that is actually condensation from the humidity in the environment. For that we recommend a fresh desiccant pouch with each dive. Gotta be fresh otherwise it might release moisture.Lastly I might recommend checking the o-ring gland for any dips or cracks that might have been caused by the gluing process. Tiny cracks or â€œcrazingâ€ù usually doesnâ€™t leak water but a divot from the laser cutting process, although rare, can be the culprit.Z",Douglas_Butler,Desiccant works for condensation and very small leaks.  But when you get 20ml the desiccant is going to be overwhelmed and the water will move around as you recover the ROV.  In that case some silica gel such as a feminine napkin or small diaper will grab the water and stop it from moving and doing more damage.,marcus2,"Yay!Positive update here; after reassembling all electronics (no visible corrosion or oxidation anywhere, at least what i could see) everything is back on track and works as expected, the only thing i notice is that i have seem to lost the simple theme plugin, but i believe that i only have to reinstall it again.<br>\nWill update here when i have performed leakage detection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IchthyoEcologist,"What combination of controller and computer do you like to use to run your ROV?  I did not like the keyboard controls so I got a Logitec F310 gamepad, which made piloting much more enjoyable.  The gamepad works well on my HP Pavilion laptop running Windows 7.  However, the battery life on my laptop is very poor, itâ€™s bulky, and the screen is hard to see in the sun.I am currently experimenting with an Insignia tablet running Android 6.0.  The tablet does not seem to recognize the F310 gamepad (which is plugged in through a mini-usb to usb adapter).  It also wonâ€™t recognize my generic XBox USB controller (which behaved strangely on my computer, but worked).  The on-screen controls do not seem very responsive or intuitive, although I havenâ€™t played with them much.  Furthermore, on the Android, I canâ€™t figure out how to hide the â€œhorizon lineâ€ù in the cockpit or the onscreen controls.Iâ€™ve also previously tried the &lt;$200 Lenovo Ideapad running Windows 10 with the F310 controller, which worked well.  However, the shape and size of a laptop does not seem ideal, and there are a lot of tablets for half of the price of this system (which is important to me, considering the risks that the computer is exposed to while afield).To use my ROV on computers without an ethernet plug, I made a wifi system using the suggestions given on this forum.Would a tablet running the Windows 10 OS or Amazon Fire be more similar to the experience I get from my laptop?

Great work!I can easily imagine that you lost a lot of propellers with this design. The thruster are very exposed at the side of the vehicle. So it is very likely that the propellers will get stuck for example by debris or by a nearby obstacle. They then draw themselves of the thrusters (this happened to me as well). I would strongly recommend to built a flush housing for those propellers to protect them. This could also be accomplished with the shell that you are planning to built.What do you mean with â€œmove the tetherâ€ù? I would agree that is hard to use that tether in a rough environment as it gets stuck occasionally. You might look into the various threads here on the forum to change the tether buoyancy.

You should initialize the PWM to 90 degrees to essentially put the ESC in itâ€™s idle state.  I expect there is a bit of  dead band around this so that as long as the PWM is operational withing a few seconds of the ESC being powered up it will not lock itself out.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lhtandroid773,"Late to the party I know, but neverthelessâ€_Is there a possibility of having twin cameras in future versions of Trident for true 3D viewing through NVidia 3DVision/Oculus/Vive?Or, as alternative for the upcoming single-camera version, some kind of clip-on accessory that works like a pair of trench-periscopes, pulling left and right â€œeyeâ€ù viewpoints into the single onboard camera as a single image, which could then be separated later in software?Cheers,<br>\nJim",Eric_Stackpole,"Hey Jim!Trident has one built in camera but youâ€™re definitely not the first to bring up the idea of a stereoscopic camera add on.  Trident has a hole pattern (50mm spaced M3 holes) on the bottom, and there is a WiFi interface that should allow many of the off-the-shelf camera systems coming out to communicate with the OpenROV software.   Weâ€™re focusing on the core design of Trident right now but support for those sorts of things should start emerging once they start shipping.  Incidentally, weâ€™ve found that stereoscopic imagery doesnâ€™t add as much to the VR experience as youâ€™d think.  As a priority, 360-degree (or other wide angle) field of view seems to help much more with immersiveness. Itâ€™s exciting to us that so many products are coming out that support this kind of thing, and weâ€™re looking forward to seeing how they can integrate with the Trident platform.Thanks for the good question!Eric",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I plugged in one of my thruster ESC connections to test.Maybe <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/walt_holm"">@Walt_Holm</a> can chime in, but I <em>think</em> you can install another ESC on top of the middle (vertical) one, have the motor outputs go to three of the AUX wires on the DB25 and have the control connector go to D9.Maybe one of these modified control boards would be good for the experimental store?",Walt_Holm,"Yeah, back in the spring I put together an experimental OpenROV on steroids.  Heavier tube all around, bigger batteries, and a vertrans thruster configuration- there were two vertical thrusters, each mounted (IIRC) 25 degrees from vertical, that allowed for greater vertical thrust than the stock OpenROV, and a limited amount of lateral (strafing) motion.  Iâ€™ll try to get some photos up on the forum today.The vehicle came out pretty good, and was working okay until I imploded it on a deep dive at Lake Tahoe.  Endcap failure at 212 meters.  Iâ€™m going to make an improved version of the vehicle, with CNC endcaps, but thatâ€™s on hold until this fall.The current controller board can handle a 4th thruster pretty well, but youâ€™ll have to do the modification work yourself.  Kevin and I are toying with a crazy scheme to mount 6 ESCs on the controller board, and do a full vectored-thrust implementation.  This will take quite a bit more home surgery with the controller board.I believe SW build 30.0.2 includes the files you need to do a 4-thruster vertrans ROV.  If you want a 4th thruster for straight lateral control, youâ€™ll need to create your own motor configuration file for that.  Itâ€™s not hard if youâ€™ve done some Arduino programming before.-W",BlueRoamer,"Thanks for the response. I guess I am out of luck.

You have to reprogram it to operate in forward and reverse, since from the factory it is set up to operate in forwards only.The 4th ESC is mounted on top of the middle one, and the power wires  (red and black) go into the spare pads located by the power pads for the center ESC.  The outputs of the ESC go to the DB-25 pins TP23-TP25, but note that they are soldered directly to the DB-25 connector- the test point pads on the controller board cannot handle the current of an ESC.  Hereâ€™s a picture of how I route the ESC output wiring:<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/a/a01c0ad4fd67f7ce68ac7b9e5d8bd0cee122ee93.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/a01c0ad4fd67f7ce68ac7b9e5d8bd0cee122ee93"" title=""607.jpg""><img  width=""666"" height=""499""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">607.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">3968x2976 557 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div> I <em>carefully</em> enlarged some of the spare output pads with a drill, making sure that I didnâ€™t short any board layers, and that the drill shavings didnâ€™t short anything out.  The ESC output wires go down through these holes, and connect to the appropriate leads directly on the DB-25 connector.The fourth ESC is plugged into the servo connector marked D9.  The OpenROV software now has a plugin for vertrans ROVs with a fourth ESC connected to D9.With 3 spare wires left (TP20-TP22), I installed wiring for 2 sets of external lights.  TP21 and TP22 were routed to PWM3- and PWM4-, to give PWM control of the 2 sets of lights.  Ordinarily you would finish wiring the lights to PWM3+ and PWM4+, whose jumpers would be set up to provide battery voltage.  In this case, both sets of external lights can draw off the same (+) battery voltage applied to TP20.  But the traces and jumpers associated with the PWM channels are designed for 2A maximum, and two sets of lights could draw more than that.  So I ran the wire from TP20 over to the polyfuse at the input of the 5V supply- this was an easy place to tap into a bus that had high-current battery voltage available.Hope these ideas are useful for folks.-Walt",BlueRoamer,"Thatâ€™s a big help!<br>\nThe thruster is mounted and my extra ESC just arrived, so Iâ€™ll get on that right away.

So the idea is to have this general development board with a WiFi chip on it(I am currently designing a board using ESP8266, will post the update on this project later tonight). So this module will then connect to the wifi access point that is running on the Trident. To communicate with the wifi module, we can use TCP/IP,GET/POST, etc., whatever that ESP8266 supports.On the browser side, the user should create a cockpit plugin (using nodejs/javascript), depending on what you want to do with it. For example, if we want to add and control external lights using this external payload module, we can then create a cockpit plugin that will send GET/POST request (or whatever you are convenient with) to the ESP8266 whenever the user press a certain button.On the ESP8266 side, we can just say â€œif ESP8266 receive X command/request, turn on/off external lights, then respond back to Tridentâ€ùThis module will be powered by 14V battery. On the board itself, you will have access to several GPIOs, ADC, 14V out, 5v out (3A max), and 3v3 out (1A max) (I will post the layout of the prototype board with ESP8266 that I just designed later tonight).I hope this helps.

As of now, Iâ€™m currently working with ESP8266, and as you just mentioned, ESP8266 works with Arduino IDE, and can be programmed wirelessly without internet connection so you can change your code while flying your Trident (your laptop and ESP8266 just need to be connected to the same network). So those are the big advantages of using ESP8266.On the other hand, P1 is more powerful (more GPIOs, ADC, ARM cortex M3, etc.)So Iâ€™m also curious what people want to use the external payload for.

TCIII,"Hi All,<br>\nI have purchased an OpenROV 2.8 Developerâ€™s Controller Kit that I plan to use with three Blue Robotics (BR) T100 Thrusters. The BR Thrusters can work off of a voltage range of 6 - 16 vdc and consume 135 watts each when run at full speed.<br>\nI plan to power the OpenROV 2.8 Controller with two 3S LiPo batteries which when full charged will reach a voltage of around 12.6 vdc. Is this an excessive input voltage for the OpenROV 2.8 Controller or can the Controller handle this voltage. Under load I am sure that the battery voltage will probably run at 12 vdc or a little under.<br>\nSince I plan to use 12 vdc batteries the BR T100 Thrusters will draw around 11.25 amps each maximum which does not leave much headroom if I use the present OpenROV 2.8 Controller 12 amp ESCs. Will it be a smart move to replace the existing 12 amp ESCs with say, 20 amp ESCs of the same physical size?<br>\nRegards,<br>\nTCIII AVD",Walt_Holm,"The voltage is fine.  The controller is designed to work up to a 4S battery pack.The current draw is a bigger issue.  The OpenROV thrusters draw about 7A each at full throttle, and the controller board is designed to work with this load.  People have had success using the controller board with T100 thrusters using the stock LiFePO4 batteries, which gives a nominal battery bus voltage of 9.6V.  The T100 thrusters will draw a little more current than the OpenROV units, but things still seem to work OK.  With LiPo batteries and a nominal battery bus voltage of about 11.1V (12.6V peak), then the current starts getting a bit out of hand.You can replace the 12A ESCs with 20A units, but there are other areas on the board that start to break down- the current through the DB-25 connector, the current through the battery blocking diodes, the current through the various current sensing resistor shunts, and on and on.  In a nutshell, full-throttle operation of the T100 thrusters with LiPO batteries is going to push things to the point where I suspect something is going to fail.I think in your case the best move would be to wire things up the way you currently have planned, and run your ROV for a while while being careful about the use of full throttle.  Once you have a design that you like, you can re-evaluate the hardware and figure out what you need to do over the long term to make the electrical system reliable.Alternatively, if you havenâ€™t purchased your batteries yet, look into using a 9.6V LiFePO4 battery pack in place of the LiPo packs.Hope that helps.-W",TCIII,"Hi Walt,<br>\nThanks for the insights, much appreciated. I will look into the LiFePO4 battery packs, but most of the brick style packs have very low discharge rates compared to LiPo batteries.<br>\nRegards,<br>\nTCIII AVD",TCIII,"Hi Walt,<br>\nWould it be possible to power the ESCs separately from the controller board, not though the controller board, and still use the 3S LiPos for both the ESCs and the controller board?",Walt_Holm,"Sure, thatâ€™s actually the smart thing to do if you want to drive a large ROV using the OpenROV controller board.  Just remove the 3 ESCs (they wonâ€™t be needed), and plug the servo wires of the external ESCs into the appropriate servo connections on the controller board.The only tricky thing on this is how to turn power on and off to the remote ESCs.  There are a couple of ways to run a signal from the controller board to an external switch that turns the external ESCs on and off, but youâ€™ll need to study the schematic of the controller board a bit to figure out how to do this- thereâ€™s not a handy place to hook up a signal for an external switch.  Thatâ€™s one thing thatâ€™s on the Github issues list right now to add to the 2.9 Controller Board.-W",TCIII,"<span class=""mention"">@Walt</span>,<br>\nI have decided to keep the Controller Board in its present configuration, though I might upgrade the ESCs, and use 5000 mah 9.6 vdc 40 amp discharge rate NiMH batteries. The batteries can be purchased for around $72USD each plus shipping. I will then limit the thrust to the T100 Thrusters to less than 4.<br>\nRegards,<br>\nTCIII AVD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LeeC,"Hi all,<br>\nIâ€™m new here and on the verge of pressing the Trident buy button. I am very excited about seeing such a capable rov at this price point but itâ€™s killing me to know a bit more about it. I have been reading as much as I can find on the Trident and I know the design is still fluid, but I would really like to know what sensors will most likely be included. Obviously I am not looking to hold you to anything as I know everything is not finalized, but what would be your best guess? So far Iâ€™ve gathered that there will be an HD camera with lighting and a GPS on the float, but what about any of the following:<br>\nIMU?<br>\nDepth?<br>\nTemperature?I also believe I read somewhere the onboard computer will likely be a raspberry pi, is that correct?Thanks in advance to any info you offer and keep up the great work!!!-Lee",Brendan,"Iâ€™m pretty sure the trident will have an IMU and depth sensor. The float will probably have WiFi too. The onboard computer in the 2.8 ROV is a beagle bone black, but I have no idea if they will stay with that config or switch to the RPi. There are some people running the software on the Pi, but itâ€™s not officially supported and usually involves building a custom image. There is a payload option being developed for the trident, so itâ€™s likely that anything not included as standard could be added later. Iâ€™m pretty sure a go-pro mount will be included on the payload list too.",Scott_W,IMU was the 1st Question I asked as wellIt will come with an IMU built in out of the boxSo should have heading depth roll/pitch yawl and it can give an inferred temperature though sensor,LeeC,"Great, I was hoping it would have an imu and the depth sensor is a definite bonus!

h_fiyouz,"Hi everyone,<br>\nToday Iâ€™m going to share +15 years of my experiences about underwater thruster and the parameters which tunned them exceptional one. The parameters have been arranged from the most important to least important ones.1- <strong>Reliability:</strong> Reliability is the most important parameter for whom that knows the value of the time. Logistic costs for industrial operations are among the highest one, and unreliable thrusters easily terminate the operations and increase the cost dramatically.2- <strong>Redundancy:</strong> Every system is subjected to damage, even the most reliable and professional one. Here redundancy helps the systems to keep working in most critical conditions. Redundancy in sealing, motor controller PcB and etc reveals its value when some trouble comes through within critical operations.3- <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Tethers always have the highest portion of drag force especially in high current waters. Thicker tether causes more drag which results demanding more energy and thicker tether. The key parameter is the thruster efficiency.  More efficient thruster, The thinner tether the and lower drag force, It is an amazing positive loop which pushes the designer to select highest available thruster on the market.4- <strong>Ease of maintenance:</strong> Some thrusters need to be carefully checked and some lengthy algorithm be done after each operation. Most users are unhappy with this sort of thrusters. A good thruster must need least of care and maintenance (sometimes up to years). in some professional one, the thruster itself remind the user the maintenance periods.5- <strong>System friendliness:</strong> There are lots of parameters which makes a thruster to be system friendly or not. Electrical noise is one of them. Some thrusters emitted a considerable amount of electrical noises which interfere other electronics, especially the navigation system. Ease of changing procedure of the failed thruster is the other parameter of system friendliness. Most of the thrusters need the system central controllable electronics to be programmed and etc. It is very important that the thrusters be plug and play.Fortunately today there are some well known valuable options on the market, to be selected by engineers and designers as the <a href=""http://lianinno.com/underwater-thrusters/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">ROV thrusters</a>. Among them, Lian Innovative has revealed the most advanced one which fitted mostly all of above parameters. Lots of options and configurations are available from them which make the best choice selection as easy as possible. Proudly I have used their products many times and I think it well worth each pennies I have paid.<br>\n<img  width=""600"" height=""500"">",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fanelia,"Hello! I think it best to give a little background first before I ask any questions. I am currently working on my MSc project, which is to design and build my own custom ROV system. The system was originally going to be based off the 2.8, however as the project has developed, it has departed further from the openrov to a point now where only a couple of components are shared between the two (Motors, ESC, Propellers &amp; battery layout are the only shared features now), and I have come up with my own solutions based on my own knowledge and skills. The system uses a raspberry pi 2 running ubuntu 14.04 and ROS, using a usb webcam for video capture, and an arduino mega for low level motor control, IMU interface, etc. Connected via ethernet cable to ROS laptop on the topside, allowing for distributed computing. I decided to follow this path as, hey its my MSc, where is the merit in just cloning someone elseâ€™s work, plus I know ROS and Arduino well enough to challenge myself at this point. I am happy to report that after a couple of weeks I have my software down, and can control all my basic functions with a 360 controller with live video stream, and am now in the fabrication and hardware phase.<br>\nMy system uses a different hull design, but the same 3 thruster layout as the openrov, except I can change the angle of the two rear thrusters (vertically) independently via 2 servo motors (theyâ€™re in sealed chambers and magnetically linked to the thruster pods, so no issues with water). I know my power budget for most of the system, but I am still waiting on some components to arrive, so canâ€™t properly test. My main issue is the batteries which I will probably have to order from the US (UK here), and with shipping times and budget I can make only 1 order, so I need to be sure theyâ€™ll work. So from what I understand the OpenROV uses 2 banks of 3x 3.2V LiFe batteries in parallel so theyâ€™re able to provide 19.8A continuous current to the system (9.9A each), although I canâ€™t find any information about instantaneous current. So my question is how close to the current limit does the whole system run in a worst case scenario situation (All systems on and switching all motors on simultaneously)? As my own system will have a heavier current draw given the 2 additional servos constantly operating. I am trying to assess whether to use the same batteries (I use the same 2x bank of 3 layout), or instead use these batteries from A123 systems which sacrifice capacity (3300mAh down to 2500mAh) for much higher current limit (70A each, with instantaneous 120A). <a href=""http://www.batteryspace.com/A123-System-Nanophosphate-LiFePO4-26650-Rechargeable-Cell-3.2V-2500-mAh.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.batteryspace.com/A123-System-Nanophosphate-LiFePO4-26650-Rechargeable-Cell-3.2V-2500-mAh.aspx</a><br>\nObviously if there is sufficient overhead in the OpenROV batteries Iâ€™d much rather use those due to the higher capacity and lower cost. If anyone is interested Iâ€™ll try to make a post about the project after itâ€™s complete, as currently I have 3 months left before it has to be complete, along with a 40000 word report, so I donâ€™t have much time to do so right now. Thanks for taking the time to read this far, and sorry for a wall of text.",Walt_Holm,"An OpenROV 2.8 will draw about 3 amps average on a mission, thus our claim to a 2 hour battery life using 2 3300mAH battery packs in series.Each thruster will draw about 7 amps running full throttle under bollard pull conditions.  So with both horizontal motors running full throttle, the ROV will be drawing something like 15 amps.-W",noersetiawan,"Hello there,I need the same information but what iâ€™m trying to do is to power it using DC power supply.So if each motor draw about 7 amps, do I need a power supply that can supply at least 21A? At what voltage? I only have the ESCs and brushless motor from openrov store.",Brendan,"The current battery configuration provides about 9.6V at full charge, and the previous config provided about 11V. The battery setup has 2 banks of 3 batteries in series. Each battery provides 3.2V @ 9.9A constant and 19.8A peak. What length tether do you plan to use? If your tether is too long and the conductors are not thick enough you will have a problem with voltage drop at end of the tether. You can expect to lose about half your power through the cable and this will vary with load. If you use a big chunky cable it will create drag and the ROV will not maneuver well. There are other problems associated with power over tether. You will need a PSU that tracks voltage and current. But I recommend that you use the standard battery config. You will not get a power supply for $60 plus shipping that performs as well as the batteries.

If I could, how much of it would be sufficient and in what configuration for around 1 hour of operation?I noticed openrov is claimed to be able to run for around two hours with 2 banks of 3xLi-FePO4 = 9,6V (6x3300mah) =  9.6 V 18600mah for two hours correct?<br>\nCan I get by with 8 NiMH batteries in series?<br>\nThat would give the same 9.6V 22400mah isnâ€™t it?<br>\nSince I donâ€™t know how much current it could provide (known as the C rating I believe, I have zero experience in this field) and Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s way less than a Li-FePO4, would it be a good idea if I parallel another 8 NiMH batteries to boost possible supply current?Or regular 18650 batteries would be good?",Walt_Holm,"You can replace the 26650 lithium batteries with NiMH, but itâ€™s going to take a bit of work on your part.A good quality â€œCâ€ù NiMH cell is about 5000mAh at 1.2V.

You might need to get new battery tubes that are slightly longer.The battery tubes need to be connected in series, so youâ€™re going to have to change the external wiring of the battery tubes.  Since the full current draw of the ROV will be going through each battery tube, you should consider omitting the polyfuses in each battery tube, as they will limit you to part-throttle operation if you donâ€™t.  You should also bring the power into the ROV electronics through both sets of power pins on the DB-25, since the blocking diode on each individual set of power pins is not rated for full-throttle operation of the ROV.None of this should be difficult for somebody who has experience building electronic stuff.

Here at OpenROV, for the most part we donâ€™t recommend any of the batteries that are commonly available on Amazon or Ebay, and urge extreme caution if you decide to use such a cell.Recently a customer showed us a cell that he had purchased on Ebay - an UltraFire 6000mAh Lithium-NMC cell.

For our <a href=""https://openexplorer.com/expedition/returntothesstahoe"">recent exploration of the SS Tahoe</a>, we were using 5000 mAh cells that we have been evaluating and are so far quite happy with.

Far from being an amazing power source for the ROV, a set of these cells would probably only run the ROV for maybe an hour and a half.As a final comment, note that the Ultrafire cells include a protection board to cut them off at high discharge currents, and so they probably wouldnâ€™t work in the ROV at high throttle settings anyway.  This is the same issue that we had with the original TrustFire cells that were used on OpenROV back at model 2.5.  The current LiFePO4 cells that we sell on our store have a much lower internal resistance, and handle large current spikes with ease.-W",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If cheap battery banks were a viable power solution for the ROV then everyone would be using them. So it should be no surprise when I say I think that this pack wonâ€™t work very well. It would probably be okay to develop on but I would be hesitant about running the motors or any other devices using large amounts of power. Pretty much any power bank wonâ€™t work well - except maybe the massive ones you can jump start a car from. But then again they are more expensive than buying the correct batteries. This power bank will only discharge at 4.8A. The LiFePO4 setup provides 6 batteries @ 9.9A continuous and 19.8A pulse each or up to 20A - 40A total. (but this is limited by the poly fuse and thatâ€™s a different topic) So even though the capacity is similar, a battery bank designed for charging phones will never do the job, but 13 battery banks would probably work OKâ€_",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

asbjoern85,"Hi<br>\nIâ€™m considering pre-ordering the Trident, but there is not much information about it on this site. Itâ€™s a big investment, I wanâ€™t to be sure before I place the order.Max depth - 100 meters seems to be the max depth, I wish to go deeper, the sea is deep around here. What is the limiting factor? Tether lenght? Pressure hull?Battery - 3 hours of battery life is good, but I foresee needing more than that one some projects. Can the battery pack be replaced in the field? If not, How long does it take to recharge it at the max rate it can handle?Camera - I see that the camera is streaming HD, but I also saw the developers test the Trident with the casing for a Gopro attached to the hull. Is there some limitation with the onboard camera that makes you want to strap a Gopro to it?Delivery time - Can you give me an estimated time my Trident is ready to ship if I order today? I know you start shipping in November, but there are probably a lot of orders ahead of mine.Thank you.",marcolinger,"Having ordered a Trident some time agoo I am really disappointed that I receive no information about progress, final caracteristics and delivery period.You give your credit card and after that â€_ wait and see (and hope) !",Eric_Stackpole,"Hey asbjoern85!  Hopefully I can clarify some of this for you.The 100m depth limit is set by the maximum pressure the body of the vehicle can withstand.  Some safety factor has been added to this, but if you want to go a lot deeper than that, youâ€™ll probably want to look into <a href=""http://www.videoray.com/homepage/new/professional-rovs/videoray-pro-4/standard-base.html"">VideoRay Pro 4</a> or <a href=""http://www.videoray.com/homepage/new/professional-rovs/videoray-pro-4/standard-base.html"">Seabotix LBV 150-4</a>.To ensure reliability, the batteries and other electronics are mounted permanently inside the vehicle so that the seal can be professionally laid and tested in the factory.  That being said, the electronics are being designed so that charging takes about the same time (~3 hours) as the vehicle can run.  For major expeditions that have multiple vehicles, this would allow one vehicle to charge while the other is in operation. Itâ€™s also possible that an accessory could be made that would allow power to be sent down the tether, however the focus now is getting the core Trident design solid before developing accessories.The video quality of Tridentâ€™s onboard camera is excellent and I think people are going to be pretty amazed by it. Adding a GoPro isnâ€™t for capturing better video, but rather for capturing video looking in other directions.  Many researchers and divers want to make photomosaics of the places they fly over, so we thought it would be good to add mounting holes for GoPros (and other payloads) to the bottom of the vehicle).Itâ€™s hard to say when the exact shipping date would be since batch size logistics are still being organized, but our goal is to have most of the pre-orders out by March.  Weâ€™re going to ship orders in the order theyâ€™re received.Thanks for the very good questions, and please write back if thereâ€™s anything I missed!Eric",Eric_Stackpole,"Marcolinger-Oh no!

We definitely want to keep a good conversation going about what weâ€™re up to and what people whoâ€™ve purchased Trident are interested in, so if thereâ€™s anything you want to know, donâ€™t hesitate to ask here on the forums.  Weâ€™ve been careful not to spam peopleâ€™s inboxes, but maybe it would be good for us to be a little more liberal there.  Thanks for pointing that out!Eric",asbjoern85,"Hi Eric, thanks for taking the time for such long answers!Both the VideoRay and Seabotix ROVs are outside of my price range, and I believe the Trident is a better product overall. I expected the limiting factor to be the pressure hull. I assume there is a pressure hull inside the outer hydrodynamic hull, a sealed box or cylinder. Maybe I can modify the Trident with a stronger cylinder or what ever it is to get me the extra depth I need. 250 meters covers 99% of the wrecks in the area, most are at 30-60 meters. One is at 850 meters, I wonâ€™t try to get the Trident down there. <img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:"">The way you worded that, â€œso that the seal can be professionally laidâ€ù makes me think the electronics are not housed in a cylinder. Having the battery permanently installed at the factory does seem like a more reliable solution than the users resealing the housings every time they use the ROV.<br>\nA charge time of 3 hours in not that bad, we probably need a break after staring at the screen for ~3 hours anyway. I would buy the the thru-tether charging accessory if you decide to make one.I was hoping the Gopro was just to capture different angles. Iâ€™m glad to hear that the built in camera has excellent video quality.I realize itâ€™s difficult to predict dates for something like this. March sounds ok to me.AsbjÃ¸rn",marcolinger,"Dear Eric,Thanks a lot for this information !!!<br>\nI am sorry for my message but you should inform at least the people who have orderd a Trident that these information sources exist. I was not aware of this.I will have a nice end of week-end reading all this !Thanks a lot !",marcolinger,"Hello Eric,<br>\nIf the body is totaly sealed, how can the battery be replaced or another electronic component be exchanged ?<br>\nMarc",Eric_Stackpole,"Asbjorn,Glad to hear your response!  Your conclusion about the pressure hull is correct- Tridentâ€™s hydrodynamic shape is actually structural.  During the design phase we did a huge amount of Finite Element Analysis to design a lattice pattern that can handle tremendous external pressure.  Unfortunately, I think 250m is far enough out of its safety factor that you wouldnâ€™t be able to dive that deep with it in any circumstance.Weâ€™ve actually been doing some empirical tests with urethane cast prototypes this week which have so far re-enforced our crush depth estimations from FEA, and we are debating whether to fly one of our (extremely expensive) Trident prototypes when we dive the SS Tahoe shipwreck at a depth of 110m next week.  Stay tuned on our Facebook page on June 7th and 8th for that!Iâ€™ll try to keep everyone up to date with production schedules and test results as we learn more.Thanks for the interest and encouragement!Eric",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the details that you need are on Sheet 2 of the schematic.You first need to disconnect the servo hookup from the external wires.  To do this you need to remove jumper resistors R70, R71, and R72.  They are located under the ESCs, so youâ€™ll probably have to unsolder a portion of one of the ESCs to get access to them.Then you need to install an ESC for the brushless motor that youâ€™re going to be controlling.  The outputs of the ESC will connect to the TP23, TP24, and TP25 pads that are already on the controller board.  You can connect the servo input of the ESC to whichever channel you are going to use for gripper control- I believe the Servo4 (D9) and Servo5 (D10) slots are open.If you do this, make sure you take pictures of what youâ€™re doing, and post them here on the forum for others to follow.-W",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

codewithpassion,"<strong>Software cleanup and adding multiple UIâ€™s</strong>Over the last few weeks I was busy working on the implementation of a new UI based on Ericâ€™s ideas.Around that, there was a lot of cleanup and streamlining done.<strong><em>Google Ploymer/Webcomponents</em></strong>With the rework we descided to move a lot of the current and new UI over to Google Polymer based on Webcomponents.<br>\nTo learn more about Polymer check out the Polymer Project: <a href=""https://www.polymer-project.org/"">https://www.polymer-project.org/</a><strong><em>Extending the UI with additional elements</em></strong>So far, plugins would use jQuery to find elements on the UI that they want to extend, for example adding something to the menu bar.<br>\nAs this gets a bit tricky with webcomponents (because a so called <strong>Shadow DOM</strong> is used, basically independent sub documents that are loaded similar to iframeâ€™s) we introduced <em>extensionPoints</em> where you can register your elements.You can find the <em>extensionPoints</em> on the <em>cockpit</em> object when you define a plugin.<br>\nCurrent extensionPoints are:The extension points marked with a <strong>*</strong> are jQuery objects and you can use functions like <code>.append()</code>.<strong><em>InputController</em></strong>So far, to register something with the inputController, you would send a message. With the extension points you register things like this:<strong><em>HeadsUpMenu</em></strong>To register something in the heads-up menu, use this:<strong><em>Messaging</em></strong>One of the biggest changes beside the UI is certainly the way the UI and the NodeJS communicate.<br>\nSo far, every UI had to listen to the â€˜connectionâ€™ event on the <em>io.sockets</em> object.<br>\nNow, if you want to listen to something sent by the NodeJS backend:This registers for the message <em>plugin.example.message</em> send by the NodeJS part of the plugin (or another plugin).<br>\nYou want to send something to the ROV:On the NodeJS end:If you want to send something from the NodeJS to arduino:To read something from the status response on arduino:<strong><em>Simplified communication between the ROV/Arduino and the Client/Cockpit</em></strong>Especially when youâ€™re going development for new plugins with code running on Arduino, you had so far to write quite a bit of boilerplate code to get the messages across the NodeJS backend even if you donâ€™t want to do anything with the values there.<br>\nTo minimize this boilerplate code use the following code:This copies all the messages that come from the ROV (in this case <em>example_foo</em> and <em>example_bar</em>) over to the cockpit, prefixing it with <em>plugin.example.</em>.<br>\nOn the other hand, messages from the UI <em>plugin.example.example_to_foo</em> and <em>plugin.example.example_to_bar</em> are stripped of their prefix and forwarded to Arduino.<strong><em>Cleanup</em></strong>Beside the changes mentioned above there was a ton of cleanup done.<br>\nWhere the <em>rovpilot</em> and <em>capestatus</em> plugins where pretty intermixed so far, they are now split and have actually no direct interactions with the UI itself beside the settings and diagnostics. All the UI action is now done via messages and webcomponents.Beside that, a lot of processing was done on the client and only â€˜statusâ€™ messages where sent from the backend to the client.<br>\nThis was changed so that the actual handling is done on the NodeJS side.<br>\nThis means that we have now the option to interact with the NodeJS end from other frontends, for example from other languages.Messages that can be sent to the ROV:Messages from the ROV:<strong><em>Roadmap</em></strong>Currently, the development is done on <a href=""https://github.com/codewithpassion/openrov-software/tree/feature/new-ui"">https://github.com/codewithpassion/openrov-software/tree/feature/new-ui</a>.<br>\nIn the next few days there will be a lot of testing done and then it should end up in master pretty soon.What do you think?<br>\nWhat would you like to see?",Kevin_K,"All the code is pretty beyond me, but I am looking forward to the new UI!My only request is that it still remains â€œopenâ€ù and we can still try out the software builds before it becomes an official release candidate.

But let us have deeper view on all choices.tecnadyne is an old company with professional reliable products nobody can doubt about their quality, but the price is high and most  of the customers canâ€™t afford it.seabotix is another well known old company. But its technology is old, the motor is brushed, the efficiency is the lowest, but the price is much cheaper than tecnadyne. Also there is a few models that some one can select the best one.Bluerobotics price is excellent. But it is a new born company and their thrusters have lots of unreliability, seaweeds can stop the thruster. The efficiency is low and there are just two models that some one can select from.Lian Innovative is mature company. Its price is moderate, the efficiency is best and reliability is the highest. There are more that 30 models and variations. Seaweeds, Fish hitting, Fishing nets cant stop it. And there is no short term maintenance.By the way let us consider price. Iâ€™d like to bring your attention to the price. operation cost of an off shore team, Including, Boat (or ship) some personnel and . . . are fairly expensive. In professional mission it could be more than 15 K US$ per day. What would happens if the mission is unsuccessful. 15 K$ fly. Too bad.Here the reliability come to account. For project managers, it is unacceptable to loose this money and one day, just because of a seaweed!!! But let us be fair, for hobby that there are no personnel cost, off course Bluerobotics is the best choice.Itâ€™s upon to you. Are you going to be hobbyist in the future or be a professional underwater robotic expertise in the future?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

nouf90.a,Iâ€™m straggling a bit regarding the controller board. I donâ€™t understand why OpenROV have both controller board and the beagle bone.,charlesdc,"The Beaglebone handles higher level tasks, such as running the webserver that hosts the cockpit page/software, acquiring the video stream from the webcam over USB, and more. The controllerboard is host to many different electronics, such as sensors, power circuitry, and the microcontroller. The microcontroller (in this case, the ATMega2560) is responsible for being the interface to the different sensors and motors. It is connected via UART back to the beaglebone. While the ATMega has tons of I/O capabilities and can quickly service and control the many onboard devices in real time, it is unable to handle the higher level tasks like the web server. The Beaglebone theoretically can do some of the interfacing with sensors and motors, but it doesnâ€™t have nearly as much GPIO to interface with as the ATmega, which is one reason we split up the work between the two.",nouf90.a,Very intresting !Thanks a lot,teley,"For Trident, you merged this two board together?",charlesdc,"The setup for Trident is not very different. The main change is that instead of connecting the single board computer with the tall pin headers, we de-populate all of the GPIO, USB, ethernet, etc connectors and solder it directly to some low profile pins coming off of the controllerboard. Same logical/pin connections, different construction.",nouf90.a,What it the funtion of the power circuitry? Is it related to the 5 volts that comes from the laptop?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I just read the article in the May/June 2016 Popular Science and was intrigued by this project.  When I read about the max depth I assumed that it was because of pressure causing leaks/crushing and immediately had an idea.  I think it should work but you folks with real world experience may know a myriad of reasons why it wonâ€™t.The biggest problem for manned submersibles is that the humans inside need to breathe air (a gas) which is massively compressible so the structure has to withstand the crushing pressure of the water outside while allowing the air pressure inside to remain â€œsuitable for human consumption.â€ùUnmanned submersibles donâ€™t have to worry about pesky â€œoccupantsâ€ù but they do still have to protect their contents (electronics, etc) from the nasty water outside.My proposal, fill the â€œemptyâ€ù spaces in the ROV with liquid.  â€œAndrew, you knucklehead, then you are going to ruin the electronics before you even put the ROV in the water.â€ù  Ah, but what if you use the same dielectric (non-conductive) mineral oil that Ã_ber-gamers recently started using to immerse their gaming PCs to cool them or that has been used in transformers (of the voltage conversion type, not the Saturday morning cartoon type) for years?Anyone have experience with something like this and can explain why it wouldnâ€™t work?  The only issue would be that you would have to get as close as possible to every last bit of air out of the spaces because any bubble could lead to crushing. However, making the â€œskinâ€ù of the ROV slightly less brittle would allow it to flex without cracking to accommodate minuscule bubbles (think fractions of a grain of rice) that might hide in some of the components inside the ROV.I searched for dielectric in these forums but only found references to using dielectric grease for connectors.",Brendan,"The main reasons mineral oil compensation wonâ€™t work well in this application is because it will affect the optic systems in the camera, the brushed DC motor in the servo and make the ROV negatively buoyant.Here are some posts on this topic.",andrew6,"Ahhh, didnâ€™t find other posts because I was searching for â€œdielectric.â€ù Doh!  So manned craft have pesky humans inside but ROVs other pesky objects like cameras and servos!  LOL",andrew6,"Well, I actually read one of the links you provided and it looks like the only issue is the index of refraction of the liquid changing the focus characteristics of the lens.  Other than that, the idea works.  Of course, the camera is kind of a big deal and the problem can be compensated for but it is not a trivial matter.",MaxDiscovery,Thank you all for your input.I think that using mineral oil is an interesting idea and it raises another question.Letâ€™s assume that I fill the ROV up with dielectric mineral oil but only so that it occupies 50% of the interior (50% of the empty space is air and 50% is mineral oil). Because there is less air in the ROV now am I less vulnerable to pressure issues?Disregard the odd design of this hypothetical ROV - I am just curious about the science behind pressure and how to overcome this obstacle.,Fe3C,Reducing the amount of air inside the tubes will result in a greater depth specification this effect is not linear at all. So reducing the amount of air inside the tube by 50% will not double the depth specification. Actually I would not recommend this design option as the mineral oil will only be at the bottom of the tube (filling it up to the half the height). This results in an uneven pressure distribution on the end caps and consequently probably reduces the maximum depth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Took it from 0 to 100m pressure in both the low temp and high temp ranges, no issues. 30.0.4 should be ok to start experimenting with now, but is still in the testing phases and should not be considered stable. The good news is, the readings anyone would have gotten in the past for the 5837 using the 5803 library should mostly be nearly accurate, aside from the occasional overflow issues. We didnâ€™t notice too much of a discrepancy when comparing the two in the pressure tank. If you see any extremely incorrect values (like -200m), please be sure to let us know and also try and record the water temperature if you can. You can get the pressure and temperature data from these fields in the cockpit:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tim_wilkinson,"Iâ€™m looking for an electrical potting compound, preferably transparent, that has a viscosity near that of water before it sets.

Anyone have any experience with alternatives? Iâ€™ve had a quick look on the forum but didnâ€™t see anything appropriate.Thanks",vamab2k1,Can you handle some yellowing? Do you require cure at ambient temperatures? What is the smallest feature you are trying to encapsulate?I formulate epoxies for a living.,Stretch,"Why do you need such a low viscosity?  Depending on what you want to use it for, what you may be looking for is called â€œpenetrating epoxyâ€ù.  Itâ€™s typically used in porous materials (such as wood) to penetrate micro fissures and to re-enforce it.  WEST Systems offers a penetrating epoxy as well as others.",tim_wilkinson,"Some yellowing would be fine. It would be poured into an acrylic container, so ambient temperature might be easier, but not absolutely necessary (so long as the acrylic can survive). Feature size - Iâ€™m pouring around 0603 components so thatâ€™s probably the smallest size involved. The issue Iâ€™ve had with current experiments if getting the air out. Even with a vacuum, because the container is mostly enclosed with very few openings, the air gets trapped - hoping lower viscosity will help with this issue.",Brendan,I have had quite a bit of success with heating epoxies or polyurethane potting compounds to lower their viscosity. But it does dramatically reduce the setting time if they cure by exothermic reaction. I wouldnâ€™t recommend doing this with a compound that has a short setting time e.g. 90 sec or 5 min. A set time of 2 hours or more would work well. I heat the epoxy container(s) by placing them into a jug of warm water before mixing. I can also confirm that my IMU acrylic container has survived this process.,Support,"Hi Tim,When we do potting here at OpenROV, especially for things like our external light cubes where we donâ€™t want any air bubbles, we do all of our potting in warmer environments- in our case the only enclosed room in our office- and leave the heater running. This causes the viscosity of the epoxy to lower, making it easier to work with, and also it cures better. We use optically clear epoxy for the light cubes, and it is in this manner that they cure optically clear. Otherwise there is sometimes some fogging in the final cure. If you havenâ€™t, check out <a href=""http://www.mcmaster.com/#multipurpose-epoxies/=11xsofh"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">McMasterCarr</a> for epoxies- they are where we get all of our epoxy from, huge selection with lots of parameters to specify.Hope that helps.",vamab2k1,"Tim,I threw a couple things together this morning and I think I have something that would work. It flows well and stays liquid for at least an hour. It should cure at room temp but this may take a few days to complete. If you can heat it to 60 C (140 F) it will cure in about an hour. I can collect viscosity info for you if you would like and could probably even send you a couple pouches if you wanted to try it. If you want to stay with a commercial solution, Iâ€™m not offended. Let me know how you want to proceed.",Ron_Russell,"Iâ€™ve done quite a bit of potting/ encapsulating in developing dive computer prototypes and other underwater electronics. Are you encapsulating electronics, and are any of those small SMT parts? If so I would be cautious about anything that sets up very firmly, thermal expansion can break PCB bonds down the road. It may be best to use a very soft compound like Dow Sylgard if thatâ€™s the case. I have found Smooth-On to be a good source for small amounts of urethane and epoxy resins of various types.I had some success potting parts under pressure to reduce bubbles, putting them in a common painterâ€™s pressure pot after pouring the potting compound.Since our prototypes need to fly as well as go underwater, are exposed to ambient pressure, and we were using soft potting to preserve PCB bonds, what I eventually came to was the realization that I would never get our parts sufficiently bubble free without doing it under vacuum, even with very low viscosity resins. Unfortunately this needs a really good vacuum to be effective, I was able to get a high vacuum used lab pump on EBay reasonably, and make a chamber out of stainless restaurant containers. Thatâ€™s made the process a lot easier.",tim_wilkinson,"I would love to try it! I did my prototype using QSil but will probably do another version shortly, so Iâ€™d love to give what you mixed a go. Thanks!",tim_wilkinson,"Iâ€™ve been using QSil which is a nice flexible silicone sealant. However, because itâ€™s thicker than Iâ€™d like it tends to leave air bubbles and, even with a vacuum, Iâ€™ve not been able to get them all out. Part of the problem is the part the QSil is being poured into has a narrow channel (wide enough just to run a few wires) with few ways for air to escape. Iâ€™m hoping less viscosity will help less bubbles get caught, but I think I also need to look at how I can improve the design to give the air more places to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

margusnurme91,"Hi,I<code>m currently building my own ROV for obtaining my university diploma. I was heavily inspired by what openROV has developed - it is just amazing. Great work guys! Anyways I</code>m currently at programming stage where I need to develop thruster control via gamepad. I`m building my interface on Raspberry pi using node.js and the same gamepad API.I wan`t to control the ROV horizontal movement with a single joystick:-joystick forward is both motors forward<br>\n-joystick left is left motor reverse and right motor forward to turn<br>\n-joystick back is reverse<br>\n-joystick right is left motor forward and right motor reverse to turnSo that is all good and simple.<br>\nBut how can I control so that let<code>s say if the joystick is on the y=x axis (45</code>axis)<br>\nthat the motors will be controlled proportionally because on y=x there would be turning and forward movement of the rov involved so let`s say that on the middle of the top part of y=x axis then the left motor would be off and the right would turn faster than normal turning so the rov makes a arc turn.And if the joystick was at the tip of top y=x the left motor would then have to turn forward slowly and the right motor would have to turn at full throttle.I know I could use tank style control but I would prefer this way (to have 1 joystick for horizontal movement and 1 for lateral and vertical movement).<br>\nI want Pi to calculate according values to send to motors, because I have decided to send motor commands to my controller board (my custom designed board featuring Xmega MCU) in the following way:<br>\n&lt; M 1500 1500 1500 Checksum<br>\nThat would be stop command for motor. First 1500 is data for port motor, second for starboard motor and third for vertical motor.How have you solved this issue?<br>\nMy interface won`t be anything near as advanced as openROV server setup, as I have very little experience with Javascript. That is also a reason why it is really hard for me to understand openROV code. it just seems so complex and confusing.Thank You,<br>\nMargus",badevguru,"You can find our code here:<a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software-arduino/blob/master/OpenROV/Thrusters2X1.cpp"">https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software-arduino/blob/master/OpenROV/Thrusters2X1.cpp</a>The way we currently have it implemented:<br>\nBasically we pick one axis with more control authority than the other.  So if it is a decision between full forward translation and full yaw, the higher priority wins, and we calculate the remaining control range and then use that for the secondary axis.  For example, if the thrust is the primary control, and it is at 100%, their is nothing left for Yaw even though the joystick might be at a X,Y=1,1.",margusnurme91,Thank You for quick reply!<br>\nIt seems to me that you are sending data to thrusters in similar way.<br>\nOnly difference is that most of your commands to Arduino only have data for one thruster at time (except for â€œgoâ€ù)?<br>\nlike: port (value between 1000 and 2000)<br>\nIs that correct?<br>\nDo you send commands to thrusters as new input comes in from gamepad or after some certain period of time?<br>\nWhere could I see how you handle input coming from gamepad?,badevguru,"Take a look at the Lift, Yaw, and Thrust commands.

carterhbond,"Hi. I have a new IMU that I just potted. Iâ€™m happy to say we are successfully getting compass, tilt, and acceleration readings from the IMU. Unfortunately, weâ€™re not getting any pressure readings.<br>\nThere was also some concern that we might have got some epoxy into the pressure sensor, but close inspection with a magnifying visor shows that to not be the case. Also odd, is that the raw readouts from the pressure sensor in the side window of the OpenROV cockpit often read â€œINVALIDâ€ù. Would that imply a faulty pressure sensor? Any help would great, thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

badevguru,"Download: (You will need 7zip to uncompress the image)You will need to install the image on a spare microSD card that is 2GB or larger.  <a href=""http://openrov.dozuki.com/Guide/Update+Software+Image+From+SD+Card/90"">Installation Instructions are here</a>.This release covers an intensive month of updates to the software imaging process.##<span class=""hashtag"">#Important</span> Notes:The beep sequence has changed.  The ROV now waits <strong>10 seconds</strong> after power-on before issuing the first and only beep.  The ROV now users a short sequence of LED flashes to indicate the ROV is ready to be used instead of a second beep.The fix for reliable boots requires you to use the FLASH version to flash the beaglebone emmc.  After that, you can still run off the SD Card version of the image if you like.  This was an issue that would cause the ROV not to boot the first time about 4% of the time.##<span class=""hashtag"">#Major</span> Changes:The download image size has been cut nearly in half (359.3 MB vs 656.6MB of 30.0.2) meaning <strong>faster downloads and more free space on the image</strong>.\\The linux O/S has been upgraded to the latest stable linux Debian release code named â€˜Jessieâ€™.  There are many improvements including a new system for managing services called systemd which brings the <strong>boot time to about 45 seconds</strong>.\\The linux Kernel has also been updated to the 4.1.x series.  This is a massive update and with it returns the ability for the BeagleBone black to manage its pins using the cape manager.  This means <strong>this release <em>SHOULD</em> work on the original beaglebone whites</strong>.  Thatâ€™s right, this release should work with the original 2.3/2.4 ROV kits.\\Cloud9 works again!  This is one of the improvements that I really want to get out and in to everyoneâ€™s hands.  Not only can you edit all of the code on the ROV via your web browser, <strong>you can also debug the running node.js processes</strong>, batch upload files to and from the ROV, and much much more.  Cloud 9 runs on port :3131 of your ROV.\\This image support mDNS. That means you can now <strong>connect to the ROV using <a href=""http://openrov.local:8080"">http://openrov.local:8080</a> to get to cockpit</strong>.  To use this from your host machines, you either need Windows 10, Linux, or OS/X, or you need a Windows box that has iTunes installed.  If it does not work for you, you can still use IP address.\\Internet access fixed.  There was a problem with a file that was hosted on the Internet not longer being available that foiled the ROVs ability to tunnel through your browser to get out to the internet.  That has been fixed which means <strong>you can download plugins again</strong>, and the Internet updates can work again.\\<strong>No more setting your computer to a static IP address!</strong>  This release has a DHCP server built in on the ROV.  Just leave your ethernet connection to DHCP and the ROV will assign it a 192.168.254.x address.  It takes my computer 10 seconds or so to get the address from the ROV.  If this does not work for you you can always go back to the static IP address as it still works as well.\\Improvements for IMU2. Should work on all boards and is smart enough to avoid additional magnetic interference for better heading hold\\Wetty, a web based SSH client has been added to the image.  You can now â€˜sshâ€™ to your rov by going to port 3009.Running on a beaglebone white",chrisethompson,"What was the reason the beep sequence was changed?

Itâ€™s really hard to know when it has finished booting now.The lights that flash are the main LEDs on either side of the camera.  Should be easy to see.  The ESCs were beeping were a side effect of our power cycling the Arduino.  We removed that extra power cycle as part of some of the stability fixes we were making.

maierj,"Hi Guys,We glued our syringe piece into the 2.8 endcap backwards (i.e. plunger inside the main tube instead of outside.)  Iâ€™ve already ordered a <a href=""http://store.openrov.com/collections/2-8-replacement-parts/products/endcap-replacement-kit-for-2-8"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">replacement 2.8 endcap kit</a>, but I want to temporarily seal the hole so students can go ahead and test the ROV in the pool.Is there a way to seal the syringe hole securely enough to waterproof the ROV to a 25â€™ depth?  That would survive any pool test and even allow for one day of water sampling at a spot on the intercoastal waterway that is 23â€™ deep.  (i.e. the kids could feel like it was a successful build, and Iâ€™d replace their endcap after the factâ€_",Fe3C,"Your main problem with this issue is closing tube. That is because without the syringe there will be a greater pressure within the main tube than it is outside. So it might be hard to properly close the main tube. The compressed air inside the main tubes behaves like a spring that wants to pop of the end cap. During a dive this is not so such a problem, as the water pressure acts against the air pressure. However, when you are close to the surface the pressure might cause the end cap to pop off.Two ideas for using the ROV anyway: Apply the plunger from inside, and close the tube. Then use an additional strap to hold the end caps in place. Make sure this is really tight, so that it prevents the end cap from moving. Also you can try to minimize the pressure that results from closing the tube. For example heat the main tube and the air within, so once it cools down during a dive the pressure also drops (a little). For example you could use a hairdryer etc. If I guessed it correctly from your story, you could also make an additional tasks for your students to calculate the temperature difference in order to compensate the resulting pressure. (eg. warm hair in side tube --&gt; close tube and create pressure --&gt; let air cool down and minimize pressure) This can be easily calculated <img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:"">",Roy_Petter_Dyrdahl_T,"Hm, not sure I would want to put the plunger on backwards, since the pressure at depth will push the plunger inwards.For doing basic testing in a pool or similar you could just epoxy the whole endcap, and you should be good to go. As <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/fe3c"">@Fe3C</a> explains, you might have some more resistance when closing the endcaps, and you need to make sure the straps are properly tightened. Once I left the ROV running during a faire. It was sitting on a table, hooked up to a monitor so people would see themselves as they waked passed. After a few hours of continous running (no use of motors means you have quite a few hours of runtime), I noticed the endcaps had â€œpoppedâ€ù open, which is due to the heat generated by the electronics while running. As Lukas sais, it could be a good experiment for the kids to calculate how much the pressure would build up inside the tube at different temperatures. Maybe even have them publish the results on this forum.Normally what we do in order to prevent the above problem is to apply a little bit of vacuum pre-dive, using a small handheld vacuum pump like the one recommended in the dozuki. This is where the plunger comes into play, as it allows you to connect the pump to the hole in the endcap, suck out some air, and then rapidly exchange the vacuum pump with the plunger.You could off course also swap out the syring / plunger assembly with something a bit more sturdy, as the type of valve seats that are used in the first stage of scuba regulators, but this would require drilling a sufficiently big hole, and using a threading tool to make the threads.",maierj,"Thanks, guys,I appreciate the responses.Fe3C said<br>\nIf I guessed it correctly from your story, you could also make an additional tasks for your students to calculate the temperature difference in order to compensate the resulting pressure.

Make sure to keep us updated about the progress and the results. Maybe this can be helpful in future.",chrisethompson,"You only need one of the plungers to work, so if only one is in backwards then epoxy the other.If it is both, then I recommend filling both with epoxy, but do it the night before or earlier.  Donâ€™t wait until you are at the dive shop as the epoxy takes time to cure.  Use black electrical tape on the bottom side to stop the epoxy running out.Once the plungers are filled, it will be hard to keep the end caps on, so do the following.  The night before, run the electronics for a while with the tube slightly open.  This will generate lots of heat.  Then turn off the electronics, fit the end cap and put in place in the ROV with the strap around it.  As the tube cools it will pull the end cap into place.  Wet the strap and tighten it some more as it comes loose when wet.  When you dive, the water will keep the tube cooler and the pressure will keep the end cap on.Itâ€™s good to add a packet of silica gel inside the tube too, so you wonâ€™t get fogging on your dive.  Certainly do this in a non humid environment, not at the side of the pool!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We unwrapped the package few days ago and we are now building the ROV. It process is more diffifult than my imagination but it is full of joy.

I got a tube of 5 MIN epoxy without a mixing nozzle so it was hard for me to inject the epoxy. My friend and I mixed the epoxy first and then use a stick to put them into the part that need epoxy. It did work at first but when it came to the Db25 part I find myself eager to get a nozzle so i purchased another tube of epoxy with a nozzle online. I believed that the problem will be solved tomorrow and the build will carry on. Also, reading an english guide was not easy for a Chinese guy at first so I made a misunderstanding on the tool â€œheat gunâ€ù.

tim_wilkinson,"Iâ€™m curious how people are finding the BNO055 device? Iâ€™m having difficult keeping the thing calibrated - itâ€™s solid once it is calibrated, but it doesnâ€™t seem to be able to keep that going for long. Anyone have any experience with this?",Fe3C,"For me I sometimes have issues too, especially with the yaw (i believe) and the compass. After a fresh magnetic calibration the compass is pretty accurate and is an excellent navigation guide on a dive. However, i can only trust its values for a couple of minutes, until i try to refresh it with a magnetic signal. This however is not trivial as I often use the heading and depth hold which has to be turned off for a new magnetic calibration.This however is a big issue for any Inertial Navigation Systems. Over time its accuracy is greatly reduced by the cumulative measurement fault. The OpenROV is able to recalibrate the compass with the earth natural magnetic field. I usually try to update the compass every couple of minutes and I use a smartphone app for a clean orientation for myself. For me this works for the yaw/heading orientation. I do not yet use the other figures too much.Regarding this context i was wondering what exactly is the difference when the variable CALIB_MAG is 1 or 2?",tim_wilkinson,"Im using my own hardware, so I have many things that could be problematic. I noticed today that turning the lights on made it lose calibration â€_ which is a bit odd. On the plus side itâ€™s regular as clockwork so should make debugging easier. Might be a power or decoupling thing."")",Fe3C,"During thruster operation the motors induce such strong magnetic fields, that the sensor cannot draw sufficient data from the magnetic sensor and therefore approximates the current yaws through the gyrosensor in the BNO055. This process however is not accurate due to the cumulative measurement error. That is why the OpenROV refreshes the compass after the thruster have not been used for a couple of seconds. I know that a 2 states that the currently shown compass is pulled from the earth magnetic field and therefore is sufficiently accurate.I would not think that the lights actually influence the magnetic fields around the ROV but it might be possible. You could check different operational condition with an external magnetic sensor (smartphone app). Test whether there are any changes during thrusting, using lights etc.",charlesdc,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/tim_wilkinson"">@tim_wilkinson</a> having seen your monster ROV, I was not surprised at all when you said the IMU lost calibration when you turned the lights on, haha. Having that IMU anywhere near your power distribution board or any DC current-carrying wires makes detecting Earthâ€™s magnetic field like trying to make out a whisper in a rock concert. You are also bound to lose calibration any time you attempt to drive the motors. Even the 2.x series faces these same challenges, especially since it is so small with all wires, power components, and sensors close together.We have been doing a lot of research and troubleshooting with the IMU and how to use it on a small ROV, and have learned quite a lot in the process. On Sunday Iâ€™ll do an extensive writeup here to both give some insight into what kind of tricky situations the IMU can be placed in and how you can mitigate for them, the limitations of the sensors (both hardware and software), and what our plans are for the future in terms of making them more robust to harsh (magnetic) conditions.",tim_wilkinson,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/charlesdc"">@charlesdc</a> I look forward to reading your experiences - I admit i was hoping you folks would have the most practical experience with this thing (the Internet has been lacking).The 12V rail which powers the lights does run close to the chip - but not so close that I thought itâ€™d be an issue, though clearly it is (iâ€™ve eliminated most of everything else this morning). I wonder how far away is safe?In the meantime, Iâ€™m going to place an addition IMU in the forward compartment (which holds the cameras) and see how it does.",e4andy,"Is it maybe just that the huge current draw from the motors or lights causes a momentary dip in voltage, below the level at which the IMU resets?<br>\nAndrew",Brian_Grau,We have seen this phenomenon with normal needle compasses as well.,tim_wilkinson,"I checked that, and attaching the lights to a different point on the board didnâ€™t cause the problem (but meant I couldnâ€™t switch them on and off).",tim_wilkinson,"Update: So looking at my PCB, it turns out that this part of the board has a very shoddily designed GND plane which is not particularly well connected to the rest of the GND plane.

crounds,"This is my first ROV Project which is already underway. Here is a list of specs.I have begun the construction by cutting the basic hull mold out of stryofoam. I am in the process of coating the mold with plaster to further smooth and refine the shape. I have built the mold for the air tank and have all the fittings on hand. Next step is to fit the 2 thruster shafts, the rudder shaft, camera view port and light housings before fiber glassing and the carbon fiber finish. The camera view port is 1/2"" thick acrylic plexiglass which I have to shape to fit the bow. I have already made a concrete cast of the bow to use for shaping the plexiglass. I did the preliminary design in CAD and have made all my patterns from that. As I am focused on inland fresh water lakes, I donâ€™t intend to go below 100â€™ so I plan on a hull thickness of ~3/8"". The air tank will hold approximately 100 psi and is also going to be ~3/8"" thick. I am not sure how many ballast cycles I can get from a single tank, but I will determine that through testing. I will be cutting a ~12"" x ~12"" hatch in the top of the ROV. I will use 2"" x 1/4"" thick 6061 aluminum bar stock to make the hatch plate. Most of the items are on order or already in hand other than some of the more pricey items.

Once it is set, the mould will be taken out in pieces(destroyed). I have the original tin pattern if I were to build another. As far as strength, it should hold up quite well with the combination of fiber glass weave, fiber glass mat(alternating layers) and a final layer of carbon fiber. The gel coat will be on the outside, clear coat over carbon fiber weave. It is ~42 inches bow to stern. That will give me just enough room for the batteries, air tank, 4 ballast, ballast controls and the electronics and servos. It will be tight, but assembly is from the bow/stern towards mid-ship.

As for air bubbles/pockets, I plan to use a roller to get the initial layers as smooth as possible. I have thought about hooking up my vacuum pump and enclosing the ROV in a large heavy duty plastic bag after have applied a thin layer of fiber/resin and some release film. We shall see as that step gets closer. I am sure that with sufficient care and diligence I could maintain water tightness to a depth of 200 feet or so. Thank you on the design as well. I have spent a great deal of time through trial and error in coming up with it. My first couple of designs were modular, but ended up being to lengthy to be of much use for maneuvering. They could obtain a greater operating depth though.

e4andy,"Hi all. I would love to get some tried and tested cube lights from the store but $70 shipping to the UK isnâ€™t an option and thereâ€™s aways a nasty sting in the tail with the import duty.<br>\nI can get all kinds of different CREE LEDs from RS Components and i already have some optically clear epoxy for potting. Iâ€™m a digital engineer but Iâ€™m afraid my analogue knowledge is very poor so I wonder if I could get some answer to the following:Sorry, so many questions. It seems a bit cheeky when you guys have put so much research time in. I donâ€™t suppose youâ€™ve published the cube light circuits <img  title="":blush:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":blush:"">",kruegerkreidach,"Hi Andi,I have connected a 10w LED directly to the Board without any Electronic in between And it works very Good . The Maximum Output is 2000ma . I can also dimm the LED as the internal ones. I think the Could white light is more eficient. The only disadvantage if you donâ€™t use a constant current Source is that the light will be sometimes aliitle but darker if you Need a lot of current for the motors.",e4andy,"Hey, thanks. Can I ask, what LED did you use?<br>\nDo you have to map keys on the keyboard?<br>\nAndrew",kruegerkreidach,"Hey, iâ€™m using this ones <img  width=""400"" height=""400""> . I have bought it from eBay . To Switch on and dimm the external light press alt+ iDominique",e4andy,"Thanks Dominique, very helpful.<br>\nAndrew",Walt_Holm,"Hi Andrew:The circuit for the light cubes is open source- you can find it on our GitHub site.  Go to the main OpenROV web page, and pull down the tab Open Source / Electronics.  Youâ€™ll find a folder there for the External Light Cube Data Package.The 2.8 controller board is pre-wired for one set of external lights, on the PWM3 channel.  If you have up-to-date software this is already mapped to the keyboard, using the same keys as the internal lights, but using (IIRC) the Alt-key as well.  So Alt-I to toggle the external lights.The PWM3 channel can handle 2A of output current.If you want a second set of external lights, youâ€™ll have to hook up the PWM4 channel and map it to the keyboard yourself.  It is also rated for 2A, but note that if you pull 2A from both PWM3 and PWM4 you will start to overheat the current sense resistor that measures the non-ESC current flow.  Anyway, you can get the schematics for the controller board from the same GitHub site and play to your heartâ€™s content.If youâ€™re not that concerned about efficiency, Iâ€™d just wire two 3V white LEDs in series, and then put in a resistor to limit the current flow to whatever you want, but less than 2A.  A number of people have made forum posts doing just that- if you search around a bit youâ€™ll find them.There is no â€œbestâ€ù color in saltwater- it all depends upon what youâ€™re trying to do.  Colder light (i.e. higher color temperatures) will give better LED efficiency and better penetration, but worse color recognition.  Low color temperatures (warmer light) give good color rendition but shorter range.  The best color for range in seawater is green light, which LEDs donâ€™t really generate very well.For reference, the internal LED lights are 3500K and the light cubes are 4000K.Hope that helps.-W",e4andy,"Hey Walt.

Our boatâ€™s going back in the water around middle of March and weâ€™ve got two fantastic wrecks within 5 miles.<br>\nThanks again.<br>\nAndrew",B9W,"Hi I also used the cheap LEDs from ebay. here is how i did mine.But first a quick tip.  if you want to put some lights that draw higher than 2 amps they sell 10 amp RC switches that will use your servo output to toggle the switch on and off.  I think they are around $12 on places like hobby king.To start do be aware that the LEDs off ebay are crap for efficiency (the individual leds are all random as far as when they turn on, use a variable DC power supply and see for yourself) they are probably throw a ways or B grade.  but Iâ€™m going to run a large Lipo so im not too concerned about battery life.But this does equate to heat.  I originally got these for my quadcopter so had to mount them to a heat sink using some thermal compound on their backs and put them under the props. This shouldnâ€™t be an issue with them in the water.I used two 10watt LEDs rated for 12V in parallel.  They draw around 2.4 amps at 12v but I like them better at 10v around 1 amp and the light seems to be of the same intensity.  These babies GET HOT even with the heat sink but in the water they will be fine.I used a piece of Lexan for the front and used painters tape to seal around it creating a small trough. Poured in the epoxy and then gently worked in the LEDs mounted to the aluminum.This is my first attempt.  There are a number of things i will do different now that i know it works pretty well. better wire, different epoxy that is more viscous (hope for less bubbles) and smaller heat sink.  that size heat sink is not needed in water just in the air with the quad.

I have shamelessly used the open source BOM and PCB Gerber files, which is still less than half the cost of shipping from the U.S. to UK.

Iâ€™ve used it before for terminating fibre optic connectors and it is fantastic stuff.<br>\nI might try and rig up a small vacuum pump to evacuate the air bubbles once mixed, before potting.<br>\nAndrew",B9W,"Andrew,Good ideas.  I would also like to try the vacuum approach but canâ€™t justify the cost for how little it would get used by me.  Not sure if the pictures show it very well but i used a piece of lexan for the front and pushed the LEDs up to it so there is almost no loss of light or clarity though epoxy (because there isnâ€™t any).  The piece I used was just what i had laying around and was about .25"" thick, next one i make I will use a thinner piece which should help even more.  Iâ€™m going to look up the epoxy you mentioned. The one thing I noticed about mine is they shine light in all directions.  It really needs some type of reflector around the edges.  Iâ€™m thinking that in the water it will light up areas you donâ€™t want or cause a glare on the camera.  I could be wrong here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you have the correct GoPro waterproof case you should be good to a depth of 50 meters.

Unfortunately all involved persons donâ€™t know how to design this sensor.Idealy, we could talk via I2C with the sensor and get a number from it.

The disc is mounted on a pole or line, and lowered slowly down in the water. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is taken as a measure of the transparency of the water. This measure is known as the Secchi depth and is related to water turbidity.

There are various light sensors you could use (Mouser has many, many options) which could detect various frequencies of light. Are you trying to see how much light makes it way from the surface, or how much light is absorbed at a given depth (say be passing a known light source though the water at the given depth), or something else?",per_abich,"No, I want to measure the turbidity (if that is the word). basically, the particle density in the water.I have read that professional instruments mesure it by measuring refraction - the amount of light reflected by water.I have seen a setup where a laser light is sent into the water and a sensor that sits beside the laser but cannot see the light source measures. To get the ambient light removed, the laser is pulsed so that you can measure the difference beteen laser on and laser off. Less light returned means better visibility.Mapping these values to distances could be achieved by using a secci disk for calibration.",tim_wilkinson,"Hereâ€™s one open source turbidity option: <a href=""https://www.academia.edu/8319858/Open-source_mobile_water_quality_testing_platform"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.academia.edu/8319858/Open-source_mobile_water_quality_testing_platform</a>",badevguru,"And this one looks easy enough to build from scratch:<a href=""http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/14/4/7142/pdf"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/14/4/7142/pdf</a>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From there, it could be coded as necessary to the additional servo outputs, depending upon whether your ROV has a lateral thruster, or some sort of vectored-thrust arrangement.-W",badevguru,"Hey <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/codewithpassion"">@codewithpassion</a>, a couple customers for your generic servo control plugin for the remaining servo ports <img  title="":smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":smile:"">",Kevin_K,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/walt_holm"">@Walt_Holm</a> I would be looking at controlling servos with those channels.I know Stretch is looking at extra motor controls, and a lateral thruster/vectored thrust would do wonders for maneuverability, but this would take a major platform redesign.Iâ€™ve been looking at what the rest of the community has been doing with grabbers and samplers and I think using the two extra channels for servos would better serve the community for the moment until a new platform is out. Up to your team for a decision though.The other consideration is that for more wires to be potted, the 6mm endcap needs to be thickened. I plan on getting two endcap kits and just adding a second 6mm piece to each end. This way I can be totally expandable and add 6 additional servo wires for whatever comes down the pipeline.",Walt_Holm,"Have you already used up the 6 spare wires that are already potted into the stock 2.7 endcap?  If you want to focus on grabbers, you could use those 6 wires as such:2 wires for external lights<br>\n2 wires for power and ground to external servos<br>\n2 wires to control 2 external servosThe next ROV I build is going to use those 6 wires as such:3 wires for a 4th motor<br>\n3 wires to control two separate banks of external lights (the PWM+ signal [battery voltage +] is common between the two lights)Now if I want to add a grabber to that, hmm, then Iâ€™ll need some more wires.-W",Kevin_K,"Nope, I havenâ€™t tried using the 6 spare wires. My coding skills are severely lacking. If you can get the 6 AUX wires up and running, that would be great!Iâ€™ll still pot wires for everything I can think of and let you guys figure whatever plugins you want to do. I can use anything on my next prototype, lateral thruster, vectored thrust, external lights, extra servo channels etc.",Walt_Holm,"So the great thing about using the existing 6 spare wires is that they route through the DB-25 connector, and go to solder pads on the controller board (those pads are marked TP21 - TP25).  So they make it easy to wire up custom stuff on the controller board and have it connect to the wiring harness via the existing DB-25 connector.For instance, if you want external lights, you can run wires from the PWM3 outputs on the prototyping headers to two of the spare wire test points.  Then add a little jumper across R32 (IIRC) to route battery power to the PWM channel, and youâ€™re done with all the internal wiring for external lights.Weâ€™ve been playing with external lights a lot here at OROV HQ, using a prototype of a software plug-in that Brian coded to control the things.  He assures me that it will be included in the next software release.-W",Stretch,One more vote for a plugin to control the two empty servo connectors.  I hope to use them as part of a 5 thruster vector control. What would be most helpful is some way to mix and match all 6 servo controls to any combination of servo or motor.,craig_bates,I am having an issue with the video intermittent freezing up!

Matt_Colman,"Just wondering if there is anyone out there working on programming joystick control for the OpenROV? (Just to clarify, I have *no* knowledge of Arduino or programming, this is all just speculative suggestions!) It would allow full control of all the systems on the ROV without having to take your hands off the joystick? Obviously, the joystick itself (taking a Microsoft Sidewinder II as the example) would allow Forward/Reverse, Left/Right Yaw, using the trigger and the large thumb-switch to control vertical Ascent/Descent.The throttle could be programmed to alter the thruster speed, to allow fine-tuned control or more powerful (in currents/for larger transits). The hat switch could then be used to control the camera tilt controls. The LEDs could be activated using one of the smaller two thumb buttons. Finally, an On Screen Display/HUD might be handy, giving you compass headings etc. Any thoughts?",Marcus,"I am programming a joystick / alternative input control for the OpenROV as a separate project, nothing \",David_Lang,"Also, make sure to check out the UI Dominik and Simone have been working on.Info here: <a href=""http://openrov.com/profiles/blogs/openrov-cockpit"">http://openrov.com/profiles/blogs/openrov-cockpit</a>Github here: <a href=""https://github.com/codewithpassion/openrov-software-ui"">https://github.com/codewithpassion/openrov-software-ui</a>",Kevin_Fodor,"<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/1703/fa7adc82162ba624.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3bdcdfdc27b1e245ebe1dde09ea690ca66980fb0"" title=""2056-ROVUSBJoystickClientServerModel.png"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""640"" height=""480""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">2056-ROVUSBJoystickClientServerModel.png</span><span class=""informations"">1056x816 110 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><br>Funny, I have been wondering about the same thing for a while. Studying the OpenROV Cockpit it looks like it is going to be really nice. I think the arrow keys are going to be a great first step, but I have to agree and think in the long-run a joystick is going to be so much nicer.A while back I was starting to work on a pet-project called HID-Flinger, oddly enought for potential ROV control. The idea is to take common-off-the-shelf USB joysticks and ""fling"" the output to another protocol (could be anything, but my thought was that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">UDP</a> over ethernet would be the most useful). The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-963291-0403-Attack-3-Joystick/dp/B0000ALFC5"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">USB joysticks</a> are very cheap (usually $10-$15) and plug into a USB-Host port. They typically have not only the normal x,y,z-axis control you would expect but also have a throttle, hat, fire-button and various other buttons. Typically 10-14 different analog and digital outputs. So the idea is ""why not use this thing to control <b>things</b> and not just games"". At this price you cannot beat getting a number of proportional analog inputs along with a slew of digital inputs all in one nice package.Anyway, the trick is you need a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_controller_interface_(USB,_Firewire)"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">USB Host Controller</a> (on any laptop) but the usual intended use is to have applications running on the host to consume the joystick inputs. What we really want here is to be able to send (hence ""fling"") the output from the joystick to another client. The clinet would typically NOT be on the host machine, but rather some remote machine connected via ethernet or wifi (in other words a network connection).USB Joysticks and other <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_human_interface_device_class"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Human Interface Devices</a> (HIDs) provide their information based on the <a href=""http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/HID1_11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">USB HID class specification</a>.What is we took the raw HID frames from the USB controller, packaged them up and sent them out using a UDP frame and recovering that frame at the client side and acting on the input? I believe a forum member <a href=""http://openrov.com/profile/ChrisKonstad"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Chris Konstad</a> in his <a href=""http://openrov.com/forum/topics/cross-platform-qt-topside-application"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">post</a> already alluded to such an idea. His involved more than just relaying control data to the ROV, it also contained PID control of the ROV and feedback and other cool things.In light of some conversations and drawing on some of the work posted by <a href=""http://openrov.com/profile/BranSorem"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Bran Sorem</a> in his post about <a href=""http://openrov.com/profiles/blogs/software-overview-for-camera-streaming-in-openrov"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">streaming video</a> it seems like this idea is an ideal fit within the direction OpenROV cockpit is taking. I would like to know more about the internal OpenROV architecture, but it seems from this video description it is a very nice, flexible solution. I feel it is also very easily adapted to the way sensor data <b>from</b> the ROV might be handled as well as input <b>into</b> the ROV might be handled.Exploring this further, perhaps what is needed is a way to take USB-HID messages from the USB controller and package them into a network protocol frame using a Socket.io server on the host side. At the client side (the ROV) a Socket.io client would listen to these frames, parse them and use them as ROV control inputs. The ROV would then have x,y,z-axis among various other switches to control things like lights, robotic arms, whatever. I think this is what you are looking for? Me too!I put together a diagram based on my very limited (and probably wrong) interpretation of what the existing architecture is like. This is just my way of thinking it through. The yellow boxes are code which would need to be written to make this happen. The overall purpose of the ""HID-Flinger"" application would be to take USB Joystick data and ""fling"" it to a client, the OpenROV.What do you think?There are probably other possibilities for implementing such a thing as well. I have read recently of Google\",Bran_Sorem,d like it to be as simple to extend as possible.  One method is to send commands over Javascript and have them automatically pass to the Arduino.

Ion,"Hi friends:Im just finishing a Propeller design and analisys software that could be of your interest, and could be my modest contribution to this project.It works by the very well known Blade Element and Momentum Theory, taking into account the Prandtl model for tip loss calculation.Calculations take into account enviromental variables such as temperature and depth, as well as, fluid properties.Compared with a CFD, its results are good enough.Anyway, it would be worth for nothing without a lot more use, testing and comparison of results.As the simplified BETM starts from the ""small angle"" and hence, constant Cl slope hypothesis, which in our case, are not really valid assumptions, this software reads Hydro/Aero-dynamic coefficients from a Polar Curves file.Its now full functional, and only the ""Manual"" input of Prop and Profile datas is still on course.The software has been designed for reading those datas from standard .CSV files, that manuel part is only an add, not needed for making it work.Soft output are:Thrust &amp; Torque  vs RPMThrust and Torque vs SPEED (Advance velocity)Propeller efficiency vs RPM or SPEEDThrust and Torque coefficients vs JCavitation number vs logarithm (critical pressure coefficient)Radial pressure distribution (Blade stress)Cavitation analisysAll above graphic and in tables.EDITION capabilities:The whole propeller geometry can be changed inside the program.Tables can be directly cut and pasted on Excel.If it could be of any interest for this project, I\",Ion,"Hi again:May be my explanation above did not look very usefull.Let me post some pics with the results for a K7063/5 propeller. (Kort-Diam 70mm-Pitch 63mm-5 blades)The goal is finding better thrust and less torque conditions, with the best Propeller performance for the required RPM.Final approach involves avoiding cavitation.For an underwater vehicle, cavitation may happen but vanishes as depth increases.

carterhbond,Hey all! I was wondering if there was away to use more servos on the OpenROV boards.  I bought the experimental developer kit and will not be using the regular kit. I am not using the servo camera and all that jazz but wanted to use more servos for maybe a gimbaled camera and manipulators. The problem is that I donâ€™t think the board has enough servo channels. Thanks for your help.,Walt_Holm,"Hi:The 2.8 controller brings wiring for one servo (+5V, GND, PWM) out to the DB-25 connector, and from there out of the endcap, as part of a normal build.On the controller board itself, there are breakouts for six standard 3-pin servo plugs.  Three of these are used by the ESCs, and one for the camera tilt servo, leaving two spare.  One of these spare channels is the one brought to the DB-25 connector.If you need more servo channels, it is easy to get them by just tapping into the uncommitted digital I/O lines that are on the prototyping headers.  Servo PWM outputs are nothing more than digital I/O lines that have been linked in software to a timer via the Arduino servo library.  You can do this for many of the digital I/O lines on the prototyping headers.  The controller board mimics a Arduino Mega board, so you can develop any app you need on an Arduino Mega first, then easily port it to the controller board.Hope this helps.-W",tim_wilkinson,"Another option would be to add one of these Adafruit PWM boards (<a href=""https://www.adafruit.com/products/815"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.adafruit.com/products/815</a>) to the I2C lines which I believe are available on the DB-25 connector.

I only really have two possible explanations for that behaviour. The first is that the there is still some wonky typecasting/overflow in the conversion math for certain ranges of values, but I believe that that was taken care of some time ago using Luke Millerâ€™s code (<a href=""http://github.com/millerlp"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://github.com/millerlp</a>) and I walked through it a couple times myself to make sure that all of the casting between ints and floats was correct. Itâ€™s possible that there could still be a bug in there somewhere.The other option might be that the sensor has not yet finished performing the conversion and you get a bad value if you try to read it. Iâ€™ll have to dig into the datasheet again and see how it behaves and whether or not there is some kind of interrupt/event flag that is available for reading valid data.",opegieka,"Hi charlesdc,Is the issue solved for false depth data?Iâ€™ve noticed in the code, that the depth value depends from temperature (CMS5803_XX.cpp). It is wrong idea, because it causes double error value. Depth measurement should be independent. Please notice Temperature Sensor has its error. Iâ€™ve also noticed wrong behavior in raw temperature data (value â€˜uint32_t D2â€™ in the code). Example is below.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/d/dbb44eb19b50e53ed5d3160fb5c36b9543601f96.jpeg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/dbb44eb19b50e53ed5d3160fb5c36b9543601f96"" title=""Raw Temperature Data.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""358"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Raw Temperature Data.jpeg</span><span class=""informations"">434x606 40.1 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>I recived other values, for example: 2047 (it could be correct - 20 celsius degree), 1, 6559928, 329431100, 1023, etc. Iâ€™m sure, that the sensor can send a correct data, because I put a bandpass filter (from 4 to 20 degree), but frequency is unsatisfying.Can you explain this behavior? I think it isnâ€™t normal. Is the sensor broken?",charlesdc,"I recently took another look at the code for the depth sensor, and everything seemed to look correct in how the calculations are done, so I am led to believe that these abnormal values are actually being generated by the sensor itself. My theory is that we arenâ€™t giving the sensor enough time to properly process the A-to-D conversion, and so there are sometimes garbage values that we pull from the sensor. There is a configuration variable for the resolution of the sensor which directly impacts how long it spends averaging samples and preparing an output from the ADC. Currently, we set the resolution with the value 512. I believe that if we knock that value down one more level to 256, the sensor will be able to provide outputs more rapidly, though at the cost of some sensor resolution. I believe the other option to avoid these errors is to sample the sensor less frequently.Note, this is still just a theory that I havenâ€™t had time to look into too much yet. If you are feeling froggy, you could try out changing that 512 value to 256 and see if you have any change in behaviour, as well as varying your sampling rate. You could also bump the value up to one of the higher resolution levels and seeing if the frequency of gross errors increases for a given sampling rate. This would help to validate my theory.You can change the default resolution value by going to OpenROV/CMS5803_XX.h and changing the value in this section:Eventually, Iâ€™ll get a chance to pound on this issue some more, but if you get a chance to experiment with my hypothesis in the meantime, please share your results!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

e4andy,"Iâ€™ve just been testing the new build and found that when the lights are full on thereâ€™s a huge amount of reflected glare from the inside of the tube into the camera lens.

In the 2.7 kit (which I built) you put some of the black mesh sleeve on either side of the camera, but it does not block all of the light.  I have since put some black foam (the type that ICâ€™s and transistors are shipped in) in a square around the camera and that makes a big difference.  It does not cure it though.  For a complete cure you need external lights that sit out side the tube.  I am in the processing of building some.Note that this is only an issue in really dark water.

sekafetz,"We assembled the OpenROV 2.8 and followed instructions carefully. Even built the bot in an ESD protected room for the electronics sake. So to help me quickly I am posting here for any other occurrences. We could not get the Beagleboard to connect. After closer examination found that it was not powering up - even when removed from the ROV and powered through the adapter jack. So got an RMA and sent it back pronto. However, I purchased another Beagleboard and had it shipped overnight, flashed the memory, and tested on the bench - not in the ROV. power light came on - it was happy. Placed it into the ROV and the original issue from the other Beagleboard is there again. We lost this Beagleboard. Is there known issue with power off of the OpenROV controller board that might be causing this? I searched the forum, but did not see anything off hand with my search inquiries. When the replacement board from OpenROV comes, I will not put it in there right away until I test out the main controller definitely.Just frustrated in spending a lot of extra money to get the other Beagleboard just to have it killed too, but happy to know it probably isnâ€™t the issue now.",Brian_Grau,"I saw that you have reached out to our support team with regard to your issue and replacing your BeagleBone Black.The only time I have seen a controller board kill a BeagleBone Black is if it is installed backwards.

Yes we did plug it into our computer and while it would recognize it, it was finicky about the connection. Purchased another camera - same make and model - and tried it also. It worked in both the ROV and the computer. So, decided to troubleshoot the original camera further and found that the supplied white camera cable for the Beagleboard to the camera was bad. The ground wire (black) at the five pin connector to the back of the camera was crimped too hard and broke the wire. it was making connection end to end on the computer but not the ROV due to the difference in the wiring stress. I removed the all of the pins from the connector, grabbed another USB cable, cut it down to size and then soldered the connectors onto the ends. We are big on soldering our connections due to the inherent risks of crimping and wire damage like we found. Put it back into the ROV and we now are live with video. Thank you all for the help. a few more steps and we are ready for our maiden voyage .",Brian_Grau,I am glad you were able to troubleshoot this and find where the issue was.

areweir,"Just wanted to share a pic of the 3mm plate aluminum body completed today.  It is based on the 2.8 shell but has been expanded to allow for top mounting payloads as well as attachment points for more ballast and buoyancy (to come soon).  This lowering of the center of gravity as well as raising the center of buoyancy will hopefully allow the ROV to be more stable under thrust and more resistant to the large predators we have out here (which this could literally fit in their mouth).  <div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/c/c73f62a1a8f53ca2f423873d4a0b406c39d461a6.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/c73f62a1a8f53ca2f423873d4a0b406c39d461a6"" title=""shell.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""690"" height=""388""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">shell.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">1632x918 293 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>",Fe3C,Impressive! I like it a lot. How exactly did you manufacture it. Some questions came to my mind: Did you laser the parts? What is the weight of the construction? How do you want to reach neutral buoyancy? How do you want to account for the added load regarding operational speed?,areweir,"At the moment Iâ€™m not too concerned about the top speed, just durability and stability.  I will be mounting stainless ballast tanks on the top corners with adjustable position lead weight â€œfoot padsâ€ù at the bottom to allow for off-balance loads and greater stability around the central axis.  Like I said, top speed is not an issue at the moment, but Iâ€™ll let you know how it performs in the next couple days.  My hope is that the much higher mass will affect the acceleration only and still preserve maneuverability.  The increased vent areas on the top and sides around the motors are to allow for increased flow to the props. Iâ€™ve also reversed the battery tubes so they are back loading, as they presented a bit of a bumping hazard in the front (and the aluminum cover pads could be used for mounting hardware in the future. Exterior lights are planned for the underside of the top canopy forward of the pressure vessel but still protected.",Fe3C,"I get the idea <img  title="":+1:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":+1:""> I especially like the idea of a much more robust design that enables more interaction between the ROV and the environment. For example that you are able to slightly bump objects of interest. I also think that loading the battery tubes is a smart idea to increase the tubes stability especially with that extra protection of your shell. I slightly hit the river bed once and got a leakage in one battery tube.I however feel that the impact on maneuverability will be noticeable due to the greater hydrodynamical resistance and weight. Keep up the great work and please keep posting updates, I am looking forward to your built!",Brian_Grau,Thanks for sharing! I canâ€™t wait to see more pictures as it comes together!,milne50,really beautiful job !,areweir,"Thanks for the encouragement guys.  Just an update,  Iâ€™ve taken it out several times now and an <strong>very</strong> happy with the results as far as speed and maneuverability.  Obviously it is slower than the original spec, but the stability has gone up tenfold.  Under thrust it has no appreciable â€œbuckingâ€ù and turning at slower thrust is very precise.  Having the buoyancy and ballast as far apart as possible has probably been the biggest contributing factor, but the additional mass acts effectively as a dampener, softening the â€œjerkinessâ€ù that can come from the lighter chassis.  Iâ€™ve modified the shell further and painted it, and Iâ€™ll post some video next week when I take it out to some deeper water.  <div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/f/f3f3b3c15e7a128655932a5a643f069b7bdd70dd.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/f3f3b3c15e7a128655932a5a643f069b7bdd70dd"" title=""WP_20160207_001.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""690"" height=""388""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">WP_20160207_001.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">1632x918 264 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/7/79c4354c8cf13df49df15c3e3a0422b0698eb934.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/79c4354c8cf13df49df15c3e3a0422b0698eb934"" title=""WP_20160207_003.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""690"" height=""388""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">WP_20160207_003.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">1632x918 250 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div>",Fe3C,"Wow, very impressive!

The ESC will cause the motors to rotate forwards when the signal is above the center frequency and reverse below that center frequency. When the signal is at the center frequency the motors will remain stationary. The ESCâ€™s need to be programmed to access this mode. They usually only run forwards with the default ESC programming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Kort nozzle blade should be curved to fit snugly along the inner diameter of the nozzle.Weâ€™ve been doing a bunch of testing with four and three-bladed Kaplan propellers in Kort nozzles and theyâ€™ve been giving us some pretty good performance.  Our 50mm three-bladed prop can produce around 1.2kg of thrust at an efficiency of around 0.02kg/W.You may also want to examine the effects of the grill plate over your nozzle.  You may find that having that in the way is responsible for a large portion of your reduced efficiency.Best of luck!~Eric,Anupam_Chandra,"Hey Eric,<br>\nThanks for the input. I had also noticed the gap(alas, only after the tests failed) and am now working on the same.<br>\nThe grill plate was designed seeing that most commercial thrusters do have them, in order to protect the propeller from collision damage or just to filter out big junk pieces that might be floating around in the water. Anyways, I will conduct simulations to analyze its effect on efficiency.How do you guys manufacture the propeller? I got mine 3D printed with Polycarbonate material using SLA process to get the smooth surface finish, but it was very costly. Is there cheaper manufacturing method available?Also, can you share the source or blade profile details(spreadsheet) for kaplan propeller? I searched for it but couldnâ€™t find.Again, thanks for all the help.Anupam",Eric_Stackpole,"Weâ€™ve got a Formlabs Form 1+ printer in house here at OpenROV that weâ€™ve been using for prototype props, but there is also an â€œExtreme Detailâ€ù option for printing parts using <a href=""https://www.shapeways.com/materials/frosted-detail-plastic"">Shapeways</a> that weâ€™ve been pretty happy with.  Weâ€™ve learned that a tremendous amount of efficiency loss (like on the order of 40%) can come from flexure of the blade so finding something that is very rigid is worthwhile.Iâ€™m away from the lab until after New Years and I donâ€™t think I have the prop profile data with me, but Iâ€™ll try to dig that up and post it once I get back.Iâ€™m excited to help with this!Eric",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cement bound is way to strong. I completely broke my pieces while trying to get them apart. I am pretty sure you have to get new parts.But donâ€™t worry, its not hard. First idea (what i did), you can laser new parts on your own. Simply buy some acrylic sheets at a local workshop, usually depend on the size of the parts this is only a couple of euros/dollars. Then download the <a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-hardware"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">OpenROV Hardware</a> laser files and show up at an Acrylic workshop or any other workshop with a laser cutter.

I am sure they can make a good offer, the shipment however my take while.If you can manage to get the parts apart, you should be aware that you need a flush fit in order to make a proper cement bound.

joeeysicka,Hello! I have a question.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
saltspring,Iâ€™m just finishing off the build and have a simple question about the lasers.  I get the fact the if the lasers are 10cm apart one can use this as a measuring tool on or for photos. Has anyone crossed the beams at a set length to get better depth perception?  I was thinking if the lasers beams crossed at 6 ft this might be more useful than running them parallel.It would be interesting to hear from some that have used this feature.,Roy_Petter_Dyrdahl_T,"But then you would not be able to measure the size of things.

Fe3C,"I am investigating the use of an OpenROV for short range operation in gardened lakes. The operational range would be less then 25 meters. For this application I am thinking about a wired energy supply to get rid of the batteries and the charge process (and maybe replace them with a technical equipment!).What specification do i need to meet here? My first approach would be to solder the two wires from the tubes to a two wire connection to an ordinary power supply unit, that matches the batteries voltage output and is able to supply enough Current. Anything else? Any advice for a cable/wire?Thanks a lot for your help!",Fe3C,"Here is the update on this from my point: I will use an ordinary power supply unit that has a variable voltage (<a href=""https://www.conrad.de/de/graupner-230-vac-netzteil-regelbar-300-w-5-15-vdc-0-20-a-269228.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">sample power supply (german)</a>). It can supply up to 20 A.The batteries have a discharge current of 10 A max, but i feel this is for the extreme scenario that one battery tube failed and one tube has to power the whole ROV with thrusters.With practical test I would determine the needed voltage at the power supply unit so that after cable losses the ROV has a current of around 9,6 V (3 batteries with 3,2 V) available. For a cable i would assume that every water proof cable would be fine. Anything I missed?",Fe3C,Another issue: What exactly is purpose of the fuse that is in the epoxy in the battery tubes?,Walt_Holm,"Hi:Here are some points and suggestions:The ROV requires more power than you think when the motors are running at full power.  Each running motor can draw something like 7A at 9.6V.  The reason the batteries last as long as they do is that one rarely, if ever, uses full power on the motors.The polyfuse that is embedded in each battery pack is designed to protect the battery cells from a continued over-current situation, and to protect the controller board itself from an overcurrent situation that would damage the board- say, what might happen if two of the wires for one motor get shorted together.  The polyfuse used will trip at between 6A and 8A depending upon the duration of the overcurrent situation.  If you put the ROV in the test tank it is actually possible to trip the polyfuses just by running all three motors at full speed continuously.  This is not really an issue during operations.The beauty of a polyfuse is, of course, that it automatically resets once it cools down.  So no fuse replacement is necessary.Youâ€™re probably going to find that you need a power converter inside the ROV to stabilize the voltage being delivered to the controller board.  Unless you use thick wire, the voltage at the end of the tether will swing wildly as the power draw of the ROV changes (with use of motors and such).Hope this helps.  Keep us posted on what kind of results you achieve.-W",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If someone has tried this before and thinks that is a bad idea, let me know.  I could have sunk them in the epoxy, but I thought light transmission and heat dispersion would work better this way.I printed out a bar with two mounting points and hot glued it to the top of the ROV.

We should have these up in the [experimental][1] part of the webstore next month and would love to hear feedback from the community about how to improve the design. We know a lot of people are working on similar lights and want to combine all of the great knowledge so every ROV can have the brightest, best looking, and useful lights.These little cubes wire directly into the power PWM channel on a 2.8 (and with a little modification on previous controller boards as well) and the channel can support two lights.

pkaraf,"tl;dr: How is it possible for a computer connect to an rov nearby wirelessly when its wireless is turned off and it is connected by wire to an rov? Read below for details.This is going to be a bit of a saga. If you know anything about networks or ROV connections please read on! The current working troubleshooting theories include connecting through the electrical outlets, magical wifi networks and demons.I was trying to connect to an ROV and was getting the error message â€œyour IP address is already in use on this network.â€ùAfter unplugging, and replugging and turning everything (wifi, laptop, rov) on and off I changed IP address (with the ending of .3 rather than .2) and connected perfectly.It is important to note that two laptops controlling two different rovs were next to each other. The two laptops were charging in the same power outlet. My rov was being in the pool and the rov next to me was sitting poolside a few feet away.After about 30 seconds, I suddenly connected to the ROV next to me. My screen and the computer next to me showed the same image. Both my computer and the computer next to me turned off our wifi. This seemed to solve the problem. I was once again connected to my rov. I started driving my rov again and I again connected to the rov next to me rather my own.How is this possible? Both of our wifis were off. There was no direct wired connection between the other rov and my computer. The laptops were both charging in the same outlet. I know some of the circuitry is from a product that transmits data through your residential electrical system. Is this how it happened? Do the beagle boards have wifi connections that could have caused this to happen?We then disconnected the usb to the other rov cutting the power and I stayed connected to my own rov.",Brian_Grau,"This is a known situation. If you want to control multiple ROVs you can run them through the same topside box and then use a router to assign new IP addresses for the ROVs and then you can control multiple robots with multiple computers.We have found that in order to run ROVs near each other, all parts need to be separated by about 5 meters.Check out this previous post that gives more detail.Hi Guys: I think that if the problem is due, as it looks to be, to RF interference, IP changes will not solve it. Encryptation may allow for receiving the desired ROV only, but not for avoiding signal ""noise"". In RF interference, signals are mixed in the tether(antenna), and sent to the receiver that cannot tell one ROV from another. Standard solution is carrying the signals through a coaxial cable, but it is too heavy and stiff for the ROV.  Has anybody checked the tether data into an Oscilloscâ€_",charlesdc,"One thing to be wary of is that the ROVs act as DHCP servers, so they will try to assign IP addresses to computers that connect to the network they are on. You may need to assign your computers a static IP to avoid being assigned an address multiple times or have multiple devices assigned the same IP. Itâ€™s basically like connecting two additional routers to your router.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hi387,"Hello,Iâ€™m looking to integrate a LIDAR range finder into the openROV 2.8 to record distance from the seabed. I thought it would be as simple as adding the LIDAR .cpp and .h files into list of files in cloud 9 and editing the depth control code to account for distance from the seabed rather than depth however Iâ€™m must with resistance revolving around the availability of certain libraries such as Wire.h and stdarg.h. This is a part of an ultimate goal to make a fully autonomous ROV.Has anyone previously integrated a LIDAR sensor into their ROV previously or has any insight into how I could do that?Thank you in advance!Hazem",charlesdc,"Hi Hazem,There is a â€œbugâ€ù/missing non-standard feature in the official Arduino Wire library that caused potential situations where unresponsive slave devices could lock up the I2C bus. In the Wire library, there are some while loops that basically just sit there and wait for the situation to get resolved, but there are some instances where it doesnâ€™t happen, so we currently use a different I2C library called the Arduino I2C Master library, written by Wayne Truchsess. It has some extended functionality and better reliability than Wire, an example of which is the timeout function which releases the SDA/SCL lines and reinitializes the I2C interface in the event of a bus lockup. In our code base, this I2C library is contained in CI2C.h/cpp.The way you use it is very similar to the wire library.There are other variations of read() and write() that provide extended functionality in the CI2C class that you can look at as well. Because this library uses the same physical two wire interface as the Wire library, you canâ€™t use both at the same time. Eventually, it would be nice for the Wire library to add support for the timeout and bus recovery functions so we could just use that. I think people have made pull requests for it in the past, but they werenâ€™t pulled in, though I havenâ€™t checked to see if things have changed in the last couple Arduino releases. We are also considering modifying the Wire library ourselves and providing that modified version with the project so people can still use standard Arduino Wire functions. For now, it would be best to use our CI2C class for your lidar sensor to make sure there are no bus lockup issues that freeze up the whole program.Let me know if you need any additional help; I know it isnâ€™t very documented at the moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

badevguru,"The goal for this change is:The proposed key combination would be:The -or- commands show where the keyboard flops to give priority to the primary movement axis used to execute overall vertical adjustments.  So a ROV that tends to pitch to change depth would have pitch controls as the primary on the up/down arrows while a ROV that uses dedicated thrusters would have those as primary.This also allows for no change in the left hand keyboard commands when introducing a mouse.For the secondary controls I have focused on trying to keep like controls spaced together in a way that supports simple recall.<em>This needs to be driven extensively and tested.

The propeller creates a pressure drop across the control volume that acts along its area. GivingForwards Force = Pressure drop * pi * prop. radius^2To answer you question, with any torque you can get some movement of the propeller. Are you asking what torque will get my vehicle to a certain steady state speed? If so youâ€™ll need to do a hydrodynamic analysis of your vehicle as well as know more information about the performance of your propellers. I think this calculation will be more involved than you anticipated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I used 1/8"". The batter tube endcaps are also thicker. I am not sure they need to be, but they are small and you can often cut them from scrap 1/4"" any way.This is a picture of the potting holes drilled into the side of the endcap.

I donâ€™t have station keeping on my science vessel, the â€˜Bouncy Castleâ€™ and, due to currents and wind, I therefore have to anchor my self to the bottom. 200 -300 meters is not a depth that you can properly anchor. The rule of thumb is 3 to 7 X the depth (and higher depending on conditions).

luisgamez35,"Greetings!First of all is very grateful to find this kind of forums where people can give ideas about the same projects, let me introduce my self before i jump into my design project. I am a 23 year old Mechatronics Engineer and have worked for 3 years offshore as ETO (Electro Technician Officer), and that is where my project begins.One day around May 2013 I Joined a DSV (diving vessel) and for the first time I saw this ROVÂ´s, for me it was amazing to meet this kind of deepsea operation.Now I decided to build my own ROV and I know OPENROV is already a software developer and structure builder but please consider this is only a hobbie for me, is not going to be related to business.I am starting from zero and I already programmed my own software using arduino UNO but I have some inquiries about ROV. first question, Why ROVs do not use Azimuth propellers? maybe some will say is not a need but somehow we can reduce te amount of Thrusters.Well I am using a stepper motor for azimuth propultion using magnetic coupling, the command will be executed by a lever, depending of where you want to move it, my stepper motor will move 5 degrees for each step and will tell by a LCD how many degrees are the command given by the lever and how many degrees is the real possition of the stepper motor which i call feedback.for propultion i am using DC motors with magneting coupling, I havent bought this ones but i will probably buy from some internet page i found called <a href=""http://bluerobotics.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">bluerobotics.com</a>, I will use 3 Thrusters, ( 2 azimuth thrusters and 1 center tunnel thruster) all this propultion motors will be also controlled by levers which will give order for RPM controlled by PWM, I see some people talk about ESC, may somebody please tell me what is this?.now i have some questions about my connections, how can i enclosure to watertight conections? we all know this is critical and i dont wnat any leakage of water going inside my ROV.if i use 200 meters cable, will I lose data while sending from my microcontroller to the motors? pr there is no problem?I only want this project to be a 100 meters ROV, so i am pretty sure i dont need to presurize anything with some oil or do i need?many thanks to everybody who takes a second to read my post.",Kevin_K,"Hi there!Welcome to the community and hopefully you find some good ideas here for your own research and development. search through some of our old threads and you should come up with some good ideas that may not be complete due to time/money.The OpenROV electronics and software are great to experiment from. Walt Holm and I have been experimenting with adding more functionality and a 6 thruster configuration. He and I are just reduced by time at the moment.I canâ€™t name a single professional or commercial ROV that uses azimuth thrusters. If youâ€™re operating in salt water, the less moving parts you have the better. Also rotating thrusters is not a very rugged design and any hard knocks might move things out of alignment. You are welcome to try, but just know there arenâ€™t any examples (that I know of) to work from. 3/4/5/6 Hard mounted thruster configurations are most common.Electronic Speed Control. It takes power from your power source, and a signal from a PWM output and can drive a motor at a desired speed. There are specific ones for brushed and brushless motors.youâ€™re going to have to pot the wires/connections like how OpenROV does it, use cable penetrators, like BlueRobotics or use expensive bulkhead connectors.You should be fine if you are using an Ethernet data connection.Oil is messy and burns off with heated electronics.

tomshare3,"Hello,I am trying to add some new commands to the ROV in order to control<br>\nits behavior (eg control an external servo or set target heading in a<br>\npid control).So far I understand that in OpenROV.ino every command is given through cmd.get();.<br>\nI can see that in this function there is a call of getSerialString().My question is, how can I give any command as input to the ROV<br>\nthrough this serial, without having to create a new cockpit plug-in? Is<br>\nthere any way I can send commands through a terminal? (even existing<br>\ncommands like â€œligtâ€ù or â€œtiltâ€ù)",charlesdc,"Right now, we havenâ€™t yet added a feature in the cockpit which allows the user to send arbitrary commands to the MCU, but it is on the radar to add that in. It is still technically possible to achieve this goal by directly accessing the serial port in Linux on the Beaglebone and sending command strings via the device file. However, if the cockpit software is still running, it may still have the serial port open, preventing you from doing this, so unfortunately there is no particularly easy way of sending arbitrary commands yet without modifying the cockpit software or leaving it closed while you do your testing through the Linux interface.",tomshare3,directly accessing the serial port in Linux on the Beaglebone and sending command strings via the device fileThanks.

e4andy,"Hi guys.<br>\nIâ€™m a very happy owner of OpenROV 2.8. It has opened up a whole new field of exploration. The support is second to none, the feeling of inclusiveness is fantastic.<br>\nThat is why Iâ€™m going to ask this question, albeit a bit rude, maybe. Have you forgotten your roots?<br>\nOne of the criteria for OpenROV was â€œunder a thousand dollarsâ€ù. There were moving videos from Eric and David about pushing boundaries, dreams of far off places, etc. I would be surprised if the build of the trident, in terms of materials, cost any more than OpenROV, yet it will cost me $1,600 to get the device with 100m of tether.<br>\nI apologise for my cynicism, but it seems that OpenROV has just gone commercial.<br>\nAndrew",David_Lang,"Hey Andrew,<br>\nThanks for the kind words about the 2.8 kit. And thanks for the honest question.This is a tough one. First off, the OpenROV 2.8 will still be available and less than $1kTo be perfectly honest, I think we may have forgotten our roots <em>a little bit</em> over the past year. After we figured out that the new style of design would be so effective, we went into a dead sprint trying to get it ready and out into the world. We had been working so hard to get it ready that we stopped going on as many expeditions, visiting as many schools, going to as many Maker Faires, etc. It wasnâ€™t that we thought we were beyond that - not at all - we just got extremely focused. As the Kickstarter craziness has settled down, weâ€™re getting our priorities straight. Weâ€™re still working really hard on manufacturing, but we also want to go the extra mile to make sure that the process is just as rewarding as the product.Launching the Trident on Kickstarter was a big part of staying true to our roots. Thatâ€™s where we started. We had a long meeting before we launched the new project about how to make sure that our existing community members would know how much we wanted them to come on this next chapter of the OpenROV journey. One idea was to offer an extensive early bird discount on the Trident, and to give the community a special heads up on the deal. Almost all the early birds were snapped up by community members. The cost of the Trident is a little higher, but we think itâ€™s fair for the value.We have a lot of other ideas to make sure that the community stays front and center, and that we can continue to eliminate the barriers to exploration and science. Over the next year, weâ€™re going to get very creative. I want to ask three things from you:Weâ€™re more committed than ever to the mission: democratize exploration. Thanks for keeping us honest.<br>\n-David",Brian_Grau,"Just to chime in on this conversation as well. I work on many aspects here at OpenROV but one of my rolls is on the production team. We are still working hard to make the 2 series even better. We have R&amp;D projects that we are doing to improve the vehicle as well as responding to user input for accessories they would like to see. After many requests for external lights we have a product that we have developed and will be in the store in the next couple weeks (<a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/external-lights-take-2/3393/3?u=brian_grau"">here</a> is a sneak peak of them). We are also looking at other upgrades and accessories. As with all the other 2 series ROVs these designs will be open source to encourage a community of individuals who want to customize them to support their own personal exploration needs.",e4andy,"David, thank you for your very comprehensive reply. As I said, I was somewhat apprehensive about even asking the question. I believe your philosophy is as important as your technology and I am still in awe of you guys. Some sour grapes on my part as I really wanted to sign up for Trident but, having just bought the OpenROV, the funds werenâ€™t there. I will almost certainly get one when they are released as I believe it will be a vital next step.<br>\nThe community is the thing that really makes this project stand out. However, I do believe that sometimes the nitty gritty of the technology is a little offputting for some people, especially the deep conversations about command line additions to the software. I just replied to a posting by Craig1, who seemed to think that the technology was beyond him.<br>\nThe most fantastic thing is that whatever the level, there is someone to help, whether it be choice of adhesives or the finer points of the Arduino.<br>\nHaving put my ideas down in black and white I now realise that the Trident is, as you say the best way to democratise exploration. Iâ€™m sure there are many people, like myself, that would much rather spend time diving the ROV than hours trying to upgrade the firmware.<br>\nThanks for all your help and thanks for your ongoing enthusiasm. Weâ€™re watching your every move <img  title="":smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":smile:""><br>\nAndrew",e4andy,"Thanks Brian (and all the engineers). Your help is truly appreciated. Thereâ€™s nothing worse than the feeling of isolation that new technology sometimes brings, but this doesnâ€™t happen in the OpenROV community. Well done.<br>\nAndrew",Stefan_Lagner,"Honestly, im still impressed how David and Eric keeping this project alive!Monthly paychecks, real estate costs, taxes, energy, comercial free webhosting, research and development costs over yearsâ€_ All payed with roughly 2000 sold ROV Kits for less than 1k$??If they decide to offer a new type ROV even with higher profit margin, ok just do it. It will keep the original open source project alive.thumbs up!<br>\nstefan",e4andy,"Stefan, donâ€™t forget the $100,000 first Kickstarter and the amazingly successful $800,000 thatâ€™s just happened. Itâ€™s a testament to the success of the whole project and the enthusiasm of the founders. It also proves that their original hunch was right, that people are very keen to do their own exploration, rather than just read about it in Nat Geo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mike_Sinclair,"Good Day All,Has anyone implemented software serial on the controller board to make some of the digital pins into a serial bus? If, so, can you provide any tips on what is required to do so? Iâ€™ve used this on my Arduinos for other projects. Iâ€™m just trying to understand how it works in this OpenROV environment with including the library.Thanks,<br>\nMike",Walt_Holm,"Hi Mike:The hardware support for additional serial ports is definitely there.  The hardware design of the controller board was modeled after the Arduino Mega, and we chose to bring pins out to the prototyping headers based upon their capabilities on the Mega.  In looking at the pinout of the headers (Sheet 2 of the Controller Board schematic), IIRC the pins D2-D5 and D14-15,D18-19 were brought out specifically because they had the capability of being used as serial ports.So youâ€™re going to have to write some custom code that utilizes some of these pins as a serial port, and include it in the Controller Arduino code.  The tougher bit is then passing that data to the BeagleBone and then to the browser.  This has been discussed before; if you do a search there should be some threads about how to port an Arduino program to the OpenROV.  Our concept from the beginning was that one should be able to do development on an Arduino Mega, then port it to OpenROV by replacing calls to the terminal session with calls to the OROV telemetry stack.Another possibility is to utilize the spare serial ports that are on the BBB. If youâ€™re a JavaScript programmer that may be an easier thing to do.-W",Mike_Sinclair,Thanks Walt! I got everything working. It was quite simple to get the second serial port using Serial1 on D18 and D19. I figured out how to send commands over it by looking at the depth and heading hold buttons.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

kruegerkreidach,"Hello,I have some questions about the external Wires:Can i connect a 9V 1000ma LED directly to the cables for the external light or Do i Need a constant current Source ? Which colors have the two Wires for the 9V? Do i have to connect the Wires internally also with version 2.8?Best regardsDominique",Walt_Holm,"On a version 2.8, the wires for external lights are purple with a red stripe and purple with a black stripe.  See the Dozuki guide <span class=""hashtag"">#4</span> for OROV 2.8, step <span class=""hashtag"">#90</span>.You can certainly try just putting a bare 9V LED on the wires.  I suspect it will be bright when the batteries are fresh, but it will dim when you run the motors hard, and will cut out altogether when the batteries get low.  You should check it with an ammeter to ensure that the LED does not draw more than 2A when the batteries are fresh.On the OROV 2.8, all the necessary wires are pre-connected inside, so you donâ€™t have to do anything other than hook up the LED.  The latest software (30.0.3) fully supports external LEDs, using ( I believe) the Alt-I, Alt-O, and Alt-P keys.-W",kruegerkreidach,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/walt_holm"">@Walt_Holm</a> Thank you very much",Brian_Grau,"The latest software (30.0.3) fully supports external LEDs, using ( I believe) the Alt-I, Alt-O, and Alt-P keys.Yes these keys are correct for 30.0.3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are a bunch of GPIO pins available on the Beaglebone on the header that isnâ€™t attached to the controller board.

Oger,"Hello,I just finished building my 2.6 ROV after I had it laying around partly build for almost a year. I already had it in a working state a few month ago and thanks to the community I got my problem with the home plugs sorted out. After that I started designing a tether drum but I am afraid I carried it a bit far. Looking back, I should have stayed with the recommended plastic pipe tether holder and gone diving. But building the drum was fun, so it was worth it and I hope to have the maiden of <span class=""hashtag"">#1206</span> this weekend.<br>\nHere are some pictures of the drumâ€™s building process. I am using an 80 mm thin ring ball bearing and it works surprisingly well.

Darcy_Paulin,"I have put together a tether camera, so that you can get a third person perspective of the rov. It could be useful for discovering what you are stuck on or seeing how sea life is reacting to the rov.It works great in the air, but once the ribbon cable goes into the water, the signal dies, or on occasion, the picture has lots of interference then dies. Once the whole cable is in the water though it is over.I thought perhaps there was some sort of interference from the water, but that does not seem to make any sense. Perhaps it is lack of interference between the conductors that the cable relies on for a clear signal? Any one have any ideas?

It would also require an additional enclosure. It would free up the OpenROV controller board to now only handle video, thrusters, lights and all the AUX functions could be moved off. I should probably dive into Arduino programming now.Iâ€™m sure others have some Ethernet based modules that could be mounted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e4andy,"This is a big rant. Iâ€™m sitting here at 10 o.clock at night, having started trying to flash the BBB with the latest software (or is it firmware? - who gives a s**t).<br>\nI think people that enjoy grovelling around in the command line mud are weird. You type it in character by character and then it replies with  No such file or directory. Oh dear, got a space in the wrong place! So you type it in again and get it slightly wrong, but you canâ€™t move the cursor back to correct it. So you cut and paste from notes and it doesnâ€™t like that. It is 30 years since I programmed in assembler and there really isnâ€™t any need to do this stuff now.<br>\nItâ€™s a bit like cutting the lawn, only you think itâ€™s more macho to dismantle it, take the blades out and use them to cut each blade of grass. Why not use the whole lawn mower? Why not program in a slightly higher level language?<br>\nI want to look at stuff underwater, I donâ€™t want to waste my evenings trying to get round the finer semantic details of how the f****ng spanner works.<br>\nOK , rant over, but Iâ€™m going to bed really miserable.",charlesdc,"Sorry youâ€™re having trouble updating the software! Can you provide some more details about what exactly you are trying to do and what instructions you were trying to follow?

The user lights do take a few seconds to turn on.Alternatively you can try the 30.0.3 SD card version.Build your own underwater drones with the OpenROV DIY kit.For this one the system will boot from the SD card so you should leave it in wait for everything to load and then you should be able to connect to cockpit and flash the firmware.There also could be an issue with your physical hardware.,e4andy,Look like it might be working. I plugged it in again and rebooted. Now the 4 lights are flashing like crazy.<br>\nFingers crossed.,Brian_Grau,This is with the Flash version?It will take about 10-15 minutes for the process to complete.,e4andy,"Yes, the flash version.<br>\nJust about enough time for a cup of tea and bedtime malt Whisky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e4andy,Why does my battery monitor on the OpenROV cockpit always show half full (half empty) somewhere between 8 &amp; 9 volts?

The range of 8V-13V is too large for this battery type which is why it is always showing half full. The range should be somewhere closer to 7V-10V.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One way to do it would be to make a configuration of your assembly which contains configurations of all of your parts which have the density of water, rather than the actual part density. You will have to make special configurations that are solid if you have hollow parts. If you donâ€™t want to mess with configurations, you could make a block that is larger than you assembly. Copy it. Use the cavity function on one of the blocks with your assembly as the tool. Now use the cavity function on the other block with the first block as the tool. You will have to fiddle with any hollow parts to make this one work as well.â€ùTaken from the Solidworks forums - <a href=""https://forum.solidworks.com/thread/28222#124976"">https://forum.solidworks.com/thread/28222#124976</a>",w_rustrian26,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/colin_ho"">@Colin_Ho</a> I initially tried the first methods you suggested and came up with what I have.

Iâ€™ve been looking at translation and globalization libraries.  I want to be able to add translations via the plugin architecture, so that you can simply download new or updated translations to your ROV.So in general, our application would go ahead an initialize the translation library and then pass a reference through the dependencies object to each plugin when it starts.  After the plugins have all loaded, the system would call the i8ln() method to translate all of the text strings already in HTML.  If a plugin or code is dynamically adding text, it would need to explicitly call the translation through a specialized translate method that is part of the library such as t(â€œsome textâ€ù).I have been considering using <a href=""http://i18next.com"">http://i18next.com</a> as the library.  It seems to have all of the core features that we really need.The library adds a new function â€œt()â€ù that will do a lookup of any text that is passed in to it from a json resource file.In order to add a new language, the plugin would probably announce the new translation and we would have a translation manager that would register the language with the translation plugin.  The author would then register the language as a new plugin through <a href=""http://bower.io"">bower.io</a> just like the rest of our plugins.Let me know what you think of the library.  If someone is motivated to create a PR to add the library Iâ€™m happy to review, guide, and support the effort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dave5,"Just to alert you to a demographic who might not be aware of OpenROV. Cruising yachts need to anchor in water deeper than they can see. In the Pacific, the anchorages are particularly deep, and there are often stray coral bommies around which your anchor can become tangled, sometimes making it impossible to lift it.It is also worrying if you are at anchor at night, and the wind gets up and risks blowing your boat onto a reef. It is reassuring to know whether your anchor is securely set into the sea-floor.An OpenROV will be a huge boon for cruisers like us. We will be able to anchor in deeper water, away from coral, and inspect the anchor to ensure it is safe, or check how it is tangled and how best to untangle it.Whoopeedoo!Dave Straton<br>\nâ€™S/v Nimrodâ€™",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wouldnâ€™t go as far a connecting the motors up yet but it would get me going over the weekend and with the electronics side of life that Iâ€™m far more confident with.Cheers.Richard",Adam_Christensen,"I didnâ€™t start assembling any of the acrylic bits until I had the whole setup operational (including motors) on the bench and would tend to think this is a good approach, all other things aside it is way easier to debug any issues this way.  The only issue you will need to be aware is when powering the ROV electronics from a power supply with the ESCs installed, I have not worked with the newer ESCs but with the older ones most bench top power supplies could not supply the surge current they required at startup and would wind up with brownouts on the controller board supplies leading to issues with the beaglebone starting up (no damage done though).  I would get everything else together and working first, then install the ESCs/motors and see how you go (you could always power it from the batteries with some knocked up battery holders at this point).",zapgun4hire,"How did customs go for your Richard?

If the outside 1.5mm white acrylic piece and the larger 6mm clear piece do not have a cementing job that covers the entire surface, air can travel between these layers and thus have the decrease in pressure if you are using a suction cup type connector on the vacuum pump.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/2/2f01b63ed7a86e284473d341292de71d82a58ef0.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/2f01b63ed7a86e284473d341292de71d82a58ef0"" title=""Plunger (1).png""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta"">\n<span class=""filename"">Plunger (1).png</span><span class=""informations"">800x600 17.2 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span>\n</div></a></div><em>This image is of a 2.7 endcap not a 2.8 endcap but the idea is the same</em>From an operational standpoint there is no issue if this is the cause of the decrease in pressure.The other place I would check is the fill hole for the epoxy around the DB-25.

If you can get one of the coders in the forumâ€™s excited about the feature, that may speed things along.In the meantime, the firmware has a p,v, and s value which are the target values in micro seconds for the motors.  By changing those, you change what the motors will be set to.

Jim_N,"Shout out to spiderkeys, since this was modeled from his inspiration and example code. In trying to up my software game, I decided to try my hand at Object Computing Inc.\",charlesdc,"Hey Jim!Donâ€™t know if you were aware, but I also have a semi-functional DDS skeleton node available on github as well that uses RTI DDS. Weâ€™re definitely interested in exploring pub/sub architectures for interprocess, LAN, and WAN communications, but weâ€™re sort of still in the review and research process to decide which one will work best for us in terms of licensing, community, support, etc. RTI DDS is definitely one of the most powerful and mature implementations, but Iâ€™m still a bit iffy on the terms attached to their open source community license. We are also wondering whether or not using DDS will be advantageous from the point of view of creating a development environment that has a healthy community behind it.Weâ€™re really interested in seeing where ROS ends up going with it, but it looks like they are still in the research phase as well. Was thinking of contacting Jackie Kay, who seems to be at the lead of developing that interface and seeing how the overall progress is going.SensorPublisher - Project which is part of a series of DDS example applications. Publishes distance and temperature sensor updates.It uses the XML app creation method, but the framework of the code might prove useful for getting your code structured.",Jim_N,"Yeah, that was my model, lol. Thanks man. Really just want to dive into DDS to learn. Figured it may or may not be of benefit. Iâ€™m going to polish it up, make file it, etc, all the stuff we talked about and doing some of it internally but also want it out and about so I can use it in my own projects. I couldnâ€™t find anything on RTIâ€™s stite that mentioned free developer licensing. Just trail periods so I said forget them for now and try out this OpenDDS impl. Itâ€™s really just a playground to improve my coding and c++ knowledge/usage. And prep for what you guys might move to.I also need to follow up on the order. GQ was the lead on the order so I have to follow up to see what he was able to get through. He was also approved to stand up a maker space on center. Itâ€™s gonna be pretty awesome. Laser cutters, printers, dev board tools oh my. They modeled it after Amesâ€™ maker space.",dknippel,"RTIâ€™s DDS implementation (Connext sp?) is a great product.  Itâ€™s freakishly similar to Microsoftâ€™s CCR &amp; DSS technologies within their (now discontinued) Robotics Developer Studio product suite (albeit CCR survived to become what is now .NET Parallel Extensions and some of DSS morphed into .NET Rx Extensions).  I used RTIâ€™s Connext extensively for an automated manufacturing solution developed for the Boeing 777 wing skin fabrication by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Nagoya, Japan.  RTI is a legit, professional company that provides real support.  Iâ€™m not certain about OpenDDS; sounds very â€œopenyâ€ù.  If youâ€™re just playing around and have unlimited time to spare, by all means give OpenDDS a shot.  But if youâ€™re a professional who needs to get things done, I would recommend RTI Connext.  Is it free?  No.  But generally my experience has been this:  you usually get what your pay for; you almost never get what you donâ€™t pay for.  Just being honest here, folks.",Jim_N,"Sure. We actually implement RTIâ€™s flavor at work. But the point here in regards to OpenRov and the researcher community who canâ€™t afford the 10â€™s of k to get an RTI license nor have the time to understand their vague interpretation of â€˜freeâ€™ Dev license can benefit far more by introducing themselvess to the power of the DDS protocol via an Open Source development channel. Open ROV is about democratizing exploration and robotics. OpenDDS happens to play well with that for the moment. If RTI wants to offer licenses for developers on the cheap them by all means go with them, we love it. But at the level of dev and investigation with ROV/auv in the maker community, the difference between OCI and RTI in my opinion doesnâ€™t justify spending a few grand for personel dev. Besides as long as you build to best practices OCI Imps and RTI impels should play well together. So far I havenâ€™t seen much difference between the two.One additional point, I am speaking to the community. I do not know where OpenROV as an organization is going in regards to DDS aside from what Charles mentioned above. For internal, non-open source, yeah, RTI all the way. But, thatâ€™s not the world, at least I think, OpenROV is in yet, or currently plan to be.Interesting to hear more support for RTI DDS from someone in industry. Iâ€™ve got some system diagrams that show some of my proposed ideas for a potential new architecture for OpenROV that would be based on it, and it would actually be nice to get some discussions going about how people would feel interfacing via DDS or if there are other potential alternatives that can fulfill the same needs laid out in the architecture (like ZeroMQ, MQTT, other pub/subs, etc). DDS is a pretty niche technology at the moment, and Iâ€™m not sure if it will ever get adopted by casual developers, though it enjoys widespread use in industry and government applications. My thoughts are that RTI Connext and Connext Micro could be used to design the core infrastructure of the system (which community developers would tend never to modify) and we could expose that infrastructure to other technologies using RTI Connector and other bridge technologies. Having worked with Jim in the past, we designed our entire system framework around RTI Connext, which turned out to be very successful. However, that was in a closed-source situation where only a small core team worked with the infrastructure source, so I am still iffy on whether or not it will be a good fit for OpenROV and donâ€™t want my biases weighing too heavily on that decision.I think this will make for very interesting discussion, and I would really like anyone in our community with experience in these techs to weigh in with their opinions. Iâ€™ll put together those materials and supporting rationale and make a thread dedicated to exploring technologies for a distributed OpenROV design.Additionally, Iâ€™ve got an e-mail discussion going with RTI about licensing needs and clarifying whether we can maintain a completely open source or partially open source (including their headers and obj files, but not direct source), so hopefully weâ€™ll get some insight about viability from that soon.Messages have been hidden that were off topic.

badevguru,"Iâ€™m releasing a pre-release of the 30.0.3 software release that we want to get out in the next few weeks.  As always, the OpenROV software is a living ever evolving project that needs your help!Download: (You will need 7zip to uncompress the image)You will need to install the image on a spare microSD card that is 2GB or larger.Things that we would love feedback on:This pre-release covers an intensive month of updates to the software imaging process.  As a results:The download image size has been cut nearly in half (359.3 MB vs 656.6MB of 30.0.2) meaning <strong>faster downloads and more free space on the image</strong>./The linux O/S has been upgraded to the latest stable linux Debian release code named â€˜Jessieâ€™.  There are many improvements including a new system for managing services called systemd which brings the <strong>boot time to about 30 seconds</strong>./The linux Kernel has also been updated to the 4.1.x series.  This is a massive update and with it returns the ability for the BeagleBone black to manage its pins using the cape manager.  This means <strong>this release <em>SHOULD</em> work on the original beaglebone whites</strong>.  Thatâ€™s right, this release should work with the original 2.3/2.4 ROV kits./Cloud9 works again!  This is one of the improvements that I really want to get out and in to everyoneâ€™s hands.  Not only can you edit all of the code on the ROV via your web browser, <strong>you can also debug the running node.js processes</strong>, batch upload files to and from the ROV, and much much more.  Cloud 9 runs on port :3131 of your ROV./This image support mDNS. That means you can now <strong>connect to the ROV using <a href=""http://openrov.local:8080"">http://openrov.local:8080</a> to get to cockpit</strong>.  To use this from your host machines, you either need Windows 10, Linux, or OS/X, or you need a Windows box that has iTunes installed.  If it does not work for you, you can still use IP address./Internet access fixed.  There was a problem with a file that was hosted on the Internet not longer being available that foiled the ROVs ability to tunnel through your browser to get out to the internet.  That has been fixed which means <strong>you can download plugins again</strong>, and the Internet updates can work again./<strong>No more setting your computer to a static IP address!</strong>  This release has a DHCP server built in on the ROV.  Just leave your ethernet connection to DHCP and the ROV will assign it a 192.168.254.x address.  It takes my computer 10 seconds or so to get the address from the ROV.  If this does not work for you you can always go back to the static IP address as it still works as well./Improvements for IMU2.

chrisethompson,"I continue to research external lights and I am pondering the best light â€œtemperatureâ€ù in Kelvin.  At 5500K we have white â€œdaylightâ€ù of the noon day sun and at 3000k we have the warm glow of light bulbs or afternoon sun.  The later is better for photos of course, but is that what we want?<br>\n<img  width=""450"" height=""300"">We know that blue light travels a lot further in water than red light.  The best â€œlightâ€ù for seeing  into the distance seems to be about 500nm.  That may go twice as far a yellow light.  So is that the light we should use for steering and navigation?  Especially when it is really dark like in a mine shaft or a cave?<img  width=""450"" height=""392"">The catch is that a color temperature in Kelvin is a full spectrum light source, so we have to approximate to find the best light.Col temp (Kelvin) = 3,000,000 /Wavelength (nanometers)So 500nm suggest we want a color temperature of 6000k.My current external lights (below) are in the middle at 4000k, but I just ordered some that are 5700k and some that are 3000k.  Has anyone else made a comparison or thought about this?  Should we just be using blue LEDs for navigation and then turn on white lights to film?<img  width=""600"" height=""372"">",BlueRoamer,"Hi Chris,<br>\nI am a diver and have gone through a ton of lights through the years.  In my experience there is no one light that can do everything, as you have concluded with out spending the $$$$ I have. Lights that will give you good penetration in low visibilty create significant over exposure when a video camera hits it. And a good video light doesnâ€™t always penetrate the turbidity. As far as temperature I have had great luck in around 5K. It doesnâ€™t the warmest colours but it does the job well.<br>\nI notice that a lot of OpenROV people are working on integrated lights, powered from the onboard batteries. Itâ€™s great to build and create, I understand that better than anyone. But if you want the best lights for underwaterâ€_go to the companies that develop and build them. I have mounted 2 small handheld dive lights that I can change the light heads on. One style of head is a 6 degree 1000 lumen made to cut through the silt and low visibility. The other heads are wide angle 120 degree 1000 lumen for video. Depending on the environment I can adapter one or both lights for the job. My common configuration is to have the 6 degree pointed in line with the onboard camera for searching and navigation and my video spotlight in line with a GoPro. This gives me the best of both worlds as the GoPros video quality is way better than the onboard camera.Hope this helps, any questions donâ€™t hesitate to ask.Cheers,<br>\nO",aaronmcastaneda,"Hello Chris! I am a robotics student and I am using the 2.7 as a research platform. You may be interested to know that I am in the middle of a project pertaining somewhat to your question! While I am sure that the research has been done on various lighting systems for divers (this was the first place I tried to source lights), the problem is that, as far as I can tell, the research is proprietary. Because I canâ€™t cite the guys selling the sticks on how great their sticks are, I have to do my own experiments. My specific research is how best to see through turbid conditions. The stock lighting systems reflect particulates in the water column very well.

But I am an engineer, so choosing some LEDs and building a circuit was pretty straight forward.

You could use an off the shelf dive light head which would have the reflector and the housing, then attach a cable and run it off the on board batteries and controller.",Walt_Holm,"Hi Chris:For the lights that are sold by, or are in design by OpenROV, weâ€™ve just tried to scale the color temperature with the anticipated range of the light.  The internal ROV lights have a very short range, and we picked a somewhat warm (3500K) color temperature to bring out the red colors when examining things at close range.  The external light cubes that are in pre-production right now work well out to a longer range (say, 10-15 feet), and are a more neutral 4000K.  Last year we experimented with some spot beams for long-range searching, and those used a much â€œcolderâ€ù 5700K LED.  The higher color temperatures give better penetration through the water, so this becomes an issue as you start to look out further.We havenâ€™t really taken water turbidity into account when selecting color temperature.  Iâ€™m not sure how that would affect things anyway.  For turbid water, the best solution is to move the lights as far away from the camera as possible, thus external lights.-W",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same will happen if you leave it running out of the water for a while. At depth, the pressure on the outside keeps the endcaps in place, however, when you breach the surface (or the last couple of meters), the pressure on the inside becomes greater than the pressure on the outside, making the endcaps â€œpopâ€ù. This should not be a problem if you bring the ROV straight out of the water.Another solution to the problem, and the one I always recommend, is the extract some of the air inside using a vacuum pump. We have successfully used the Mightvac MV7000 for some time now, but there are different models out there that can do the same thing; look for an automotive break fluid bleeding kit. Using a vacuum pump you achive 2 things:Note that by doing this, you are creating a bigger pressure difference, so your MOD (maximum operating depth) should be reduced.",nocomp,"thxx for the tip, i was thinking about extracting some air, but, the question is, how do you do for fit the little plastic lead in the middle  of the endcaps, without getting it totally filled up with the air?",Brendan,"When you are pulling a vacuum on the main tubes, pull a higher vacuum than you need, this will give you enough time to fit the rubber plungers into end caps and still have a vacuum in the main tube. It takes about 5-10 seconds for the tube to refill with air so you can get the plungers in pretty easily.Also, I have removed all of the nylon straps. I use 356mm x 7.6mm and 200mm x 7.6mm cable ties (2 each) to hold the main tube in place. I have upgraded to 2.8 battery tubes to remove the battery straps.",chrisethompson,"Here is another solution.  Run the ROV with the electronics on and one of the end cap plungers removed.  Let the electronics heat the tube.  Some air is forced out of the small hole.  Running it for half an hour should be plenty.  Then place the end cap plunger on the tube.  When you switch off the ROV, the tube will cool and hold the end caps on very tightly.  Do this at home the night before the dive perhaps.Chris",nocomp,yeaaaaaaaaaaa that s brilliant!!!thxx a lot,BlueRoamer,"And replace the straps with bungees!

However you may want to consider following Davidâ€™s advice and modify the unit to use Homeplug adapters â€“ they are both faster and more reliable.The problem is this: the BeagleBone board inside the ROV supports 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps connection speeds, while your computer usually supports 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, and 1000 Mbps. The baluns work reliably only at 10 Mbps. Normally the speed of the connection between the two machines is determined by auto-negotiation; however the auto negotiation protocol apparently does not notice that the baluns are capable of passing only 10 Mbps. So the link between the BeagleBone and your computer comes up at 100 Mbps (the fastest supported by both ends), and communication fails.So you have to configure one end of the link to use only 10 Mbps (the other link will follow automatically). Initially I tried to configure the BeagleBone side but found that it was not possible.

badevguru,"Itâ€™s that time again and I am reviewing the cameraâ€™s that are available to see what might be a good candidate for including in the kit in the future.  Know of any kick add usb cameraâ€™s that might fit the bill? Read onâ€_Interestingly the list of capabilities we want in a camera has not changed all that much from the discussion 2+ years ago:Continuing the discussion from <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/ideal-hobbyist-webcam/1494"">Ideal Hobbyist Webcam</a>:As weâ€™ve been developing OpenROV, weâ€™ve meticulously tried to find the off-the-shelf parts that work best for our application. This has involved a lot of long discussions with companies and suppliers. One of the pleasant surprises of those conversations have been that many of them have expressed interest in developing products that specifically cater to our needs and the needs of similar hobbyists and DIYers. (A wise move if you ask us.)Recently, a prominent developer of OEM webcam parts said theyâ€™d be interested in hearing our thoughts on the ideal webcam for hobbyists. I started creating a list of all the futures that I thought might be nice. I emphasize â€œmightâ€ù because I just want to brainstorm all the wild ideas first, then later go through and filter things that arenâ€™t practical or wouldnâ€™t be worth their cost.I thought it would be fun to see what you would add to the list. Remember, this is a list of features that would be useful not just for OpenROV, but for hobby and robotics projects in general. Please leave your thoughts in the comment section below!So based on what we have seen so far here is the short list of capabilities we are looking for in a camera. Let us know if we missed something or if you happen to know of cameraâ€™s that might fit the bill",tcbetka,"Well, the Logitech Pro C920 has on-board h.264 encoding, and Derek Molloy has some very nice tutorials on using video-for-linux (v4l2) to interact and stream it using the BBB.

Here, attendees will build an OpenROV to exercise their technical skills, and also donate the finished ROVâ€™s to a conservation group that would benefit from having an ROV to work with, but donâ€™t have the resources to acquire one. In addition to just building the ROV, the units built will be used to document the coral reefs and other areas of interest on the host island of the workshop.Now that the hard part is all squared away, which is getting the project incorporated, getting interested persons to sign up and the logistics of getting tools and robot parts to a remote island- we are ready to find the right groups to get these ROVâ€™s to! We (OpenROV) know based on the emails we receive that there are a lot of people doing great work in the conservation field that would like an ROV, but either canâ€™t afford one or donâ€™t have the time to assemble one themselves.For this first workshop, we are going to have a total of 3 v2.8 OpenROVâ€™s built and tested, ready to donate to the right person.

olegodo,"Hi,I was wondering if there is difference in using a straight cable or a twisted one when connecting between the home plug adapters? Has anyone tested this?<br>\nMy tether will be 150 meters.",Walt_Holm,"Weâ€™ve done a small amount of testing on this, using both twisted pair for long tethers and straight cable (speaker wire/zip wire).  It didnâ€™t seem to make a difference over the length of cable we tested, which was ~300m.There may be a difference in crosstalk, such as if youâ€™re driving two OpenROVs right next to each other.   The Homeplug protocol is sensitive to this, and twisted pair might help here.  But if youâ€™re the only ROV in the vicinity, I donâ€™t think it matters.Let us know what kind of cable you end up using, and how it all works out.-W",Douglas_Butler,"Beyond Waltâ€™s discussion of crosstalk there is also a mechanical advantage to a twisted tether in cases where the cable takes mechanical strain.When a straight plastic jacketed copper wire is stretched, the copper and plastic both stretch together.  When the tension is released the plastic springs back while the copper remains stretched.  Now the copper is too long for the plastic jacket and it is in compression.  The compression can cause strands of the copper to kink forming a sharp bump than can chafe through the plastic jacket from the inside out.If the wire is twisted the copper metal is less likely to stretch.  Instead the copper presses sideways into the plastic as the twist tightens with no sharp points to cause damage.Ideally the Open ROV tether should not get stretched.  But in the field things go wrong, tethers get snagged, people trip on them, and all sorts of other abuse happens.SherpaDoug",olegodo,"Thanks for the feedback.<br>\nI currently have 100m of straight cable (24awg) that I want to use since I already have it. Just buy some more and splice it together.<br>\nAfter I thread that through the hollow PP rope I have its pretty much neutrally buoyant. At least my first test with a 2m test piece in salt water was. Problem here is that the PP rope stretches a little but the cable wonâ€™t. So might be a problem if I need to pull on it too much. We will see how long it holds up.<br>\nWhen the cable eventually breaks I can just change it out with a twisted one or something else I guess.<br>\nTwisted cable is quite hard to find actually. At least here in Norway.<br>\nOne could use a pair from a Cat5 cable I guess, but the insulation on those seems a bit too fragile to me.",Darcy_Paulin,"Make sure that the rope you use is the same as the rope you tested with.<br>\nI tested with a rope I bought locally, but it didnâ€™t come in long spools, so I bought a different rope on a long spool. The second rope was not as dense and did not make my tether neutral.If your rope is shorter than your tether, when you pull it in by the rope, it wonâ€™t pull on your tether, but will slide up until it is tight. It depends on the size of the rope, but for me, the tether was too thin to bunch up the rope. I hope that makes sense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

James_Sullivan,Hi<br>\nI am having problems with visibility in dark lakes here in Ireland. Its really black and dark and the lights on the ROV seem to get lost in the darkness. So basically I need more lights. Any suggestions on how to modify the ROV or to create an add on module with more lights.There will be an obvious extra drain on the batteries and wonder if I would need to rescale everything to see in the dark?,tcbetka,"I guess you just need to look at adding some LED lights, based upon their power requirements. Itâ€™s a fairly simple calculationâ€“power (watts) is voltage X amps. Your batteries will have a rating of amp-hours, which should really be converted to watt-hours. But you can simply have to do the math Iâ€™d think, in terms of whichever LED lights you go with. Once you have one or two extra lights added and can get a feel for how much power they require, then you can make a decision as to how many more you might need to add.As for the location of mounting them, I wonâ€™t be able to help you much there Iâ€™m afraid. I havenâ€™t even put my kit together yet as Iâ€™ve had too much stuff to do since it arrived. But I should be assembling it within the next month or soâ€_just in time for the winter in Wisconsin!(No, my timing isnâ€™t all that good.)TB",Douglas_Butler,"Is part of the problem that the water is murky?  Are there floating particulates in the water?  Does stuff in the water close to the camera get lit real bright and cause the camera to dim the whole scene so what you want to look at it too dim?  If so then just adding more light may not be the answer.  You may need to improve the geometry.The ideal geometry for murky water is an equilateral triangle between the lights, the camera, and the subject you want to look at.  That is often impossible but the more distance you can put between the camera and the lights the better.  You specifically want to avoid illuminating the murky water between the camera and the subject, so making the light directional so it shines on the subject but does not shine close to the camera is good even if it takes making a tin shade to put the area in front of the camera in shadow.SherpaDoug",James_Sullivan,"Hi<br>\nTB: Thanks for the advice, may have to source more LEDâ€™s and rework the board .Doug:<br>\nWater isnâ€™t murky, just dark. What you posted makes sense though and I will experiment a bit. Will be trying a wireless controller in a couple of weeks and will get a better sense of the problem.

Here our summer was dark and cold.<br>\nRegards,James",e4andy,"I guess the thing is that once youâ€™re deeper than the light from above can penetrate, you are at the mercy of power vs. light output. Also, the inverse square law probably applies in water as much as it does in air, i.e. the illumination falls off as the square of the distance, twice as far, 4 times less light.<br>\nAndrew",James_Sullivan,Thanks Andrew<br>\nYou are correct regarding the inverse square law applying in water as well as air and I will have to experiment to improve the output.<br>\nJames,Merrick,"If you get an option, maybe RGB LEDs with vary narrow emission angle.  That way, you could get more penetration with green light when you want it, white when you need it, and red to add back red light for pictures (due to lack of penetration of red light at depth).  Another thought, if you DO happen upon murky water:  polarized filters in front of LEDs and one in front of camera lens.  If polarized filter could be rotated by encoded motor, difference between two sets of polarizers could reduce (but not eliminate) particulate light scatter.  Also polarizing lens filter and LED filters could open the possibility of stress inspection (maybe) in the case of polycarbonates and polystyrenes (<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">stress induced birefringence</a>). Sorry- rambling, but ALSO depending on what RGB LEDs you choose, fluorescence could be observed when color of LED brought up to near ultraviolet.",Walt_Holm,"Hi James:Here at OpenROV we are <em>slowly</em> moving towards selling external lights for the ROV.   Over the past year and a half weâ€™ve been through about a dozen different configurations for external lights, including trying to decide whether to offer do-it-yourself kits or having them totally pre-assembled.At this point we have a design for a generic pre-assembled external light done, and the prototypes all work well.  It needs to have the finishing touches put on it for production, and that effort got put on the back burner as we got OROV 2.8 into production and the prototypes for Trident working.  Weâ€™ve only got so many folks around here, so we have to carefully pick and choose what weâ€™re going to work on.One of the things we did on 2.8 was to make it pre-wired for external lights; if you have one of these ROVs, all youâ€™ll need to do is hook it to the correct spare wires in the wire harness and it will work.  For earlier 2.5/2.6/2.7 ROVs, there will be some wiring required internal to the vehicle.Now that 2.8 is out the door, and the Kickstarter for Trident is launched, weâ€™ll have a little bit of time to work on accessories.

zapgun4hire,"Iâ€™ve been preparing for my ROV to arrive with some additional research, and read this:<a href=""http://www.homebuiltrovs.com/howtosealingwireexits.html"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.homebuiltrovs.com/howtosealingwireexits.html</a>which recommends you strip a small insulation gap in the area to be potted to avoid any water passing through a nicked cable.I noticed that the OpenROV guide at:<a href=""http://openrov.dozuki.com/Guide/Guide+2+-+Electronics+Tube+Endcaps/119"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://openrov.dozuki.com/Guide/Guide+2+-+Electronics+Tube+Endcaps/119</a>doesnâ€™t include stripping the DB-25 connector wires, and was curious if anyone here has done this, recommends it, or encountered any problems with water leakage because they didnâ€™t?",Walt_Holm,"Nice link.Here at OpenROV weâ€™ve gone round and round on this issue dozens of times over the last three years or so.  At this point nobody here that I know of does this with their stock OpenROVs.  If you correctly use the adhesive heatshrink to seal the ends of each of the DB-25 wires that comes out of the vehicle, then there is no place for water to get inside the wire.The drawback, of course, is that once an external wire gets nicked, then there <em>is</em> a path for water, and it can lead to a slow ingress of moisture into the vehicle.  If you can identify where the break in the insulation is, then you can patch up over the nick, or splice the wire, or whatever, returning the seal back to its original state.The main reason why folks donâ€™t want to seal up the wires is that its a tremendous hassle- the channel that the DB-25 wiring passes through does not have that much extra space, and you have to ensure that you donâ€™t have any shorts in the wiring harness before you epoxy things together.  Sounds simple, not quite so simple in practice.As your ROV goes deeper, this seal on the wires gets more critical.  For a 100m vehicle, the stock assembly process should work just fine.  Right now Iâ€™m slowly working on a vehicle to go to the bottom of Tahoe (500m), and it will definitely have â€œhosing blocksâ€ù in the endcaps.  Note that the method shown in your link doesnâ€™t completely solve the problem- if the leadwires are stranded, then there is airspace between the individual strands, through which water can leak.  So you either need to splice in a short length of solid wire, or you need to tin the small length of stranded wire that you stripped.  Taking it one step further still, the small area of tinned wire may not adhere well to the epoxy, so there is still a small leak path involved.  Bottom line, there is no easy method that offers complete, absolutely reliable protection from water ingress.Hope this helps.-W",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jaredarchey,"I am using the openrov 2.7 software and I want to ssh into the beaglebone to update the software from the command line. The issue I am having is if I set my computers ip address to 192.168.254.2 w/ netmask 255.255.255.0 it is unable to connect to the server all together for some reason. The only way it is possible for me to see the cockpit is if I set the ip to automatic and go to 192.168.7.2:8080. With the setting on automatic I am still unable to ssh into 192.168.254.1 or 192.168.7.1. Also, if I go to 192.168.254.2:8080 in the url the webpage is unavailable. Why is my beaglebone on a different ip than the instructions say and why does the connection either get refused or timeout everytime I try to ssh into the beaglebone.",Adam_Christensen,"Are you using the USB port on the beaglebone?  The reason I ask is that 192.168.7.2 is the default IP address for the beaglebone USB/ethernet adaptor.  If you do in fact have the USB connected to your PC, I would double check that you are changing the settings on the correct interface (i.e. LAN not USB).  Also, if you are trying to SSH into the beaglebone via the USB port leave your IP as automatic and you will need to connect to 192.168.7.2 (rather than 192.168.7.1 or 192.168.254.1 as you noted).",tcbetka,"Have you confirmed that the BBB is actually ON your LAN? You canâ€™t SSH into the thing over the LAN, unless itâ€™s <em>on</em> the LAN. So open the setup admin site for your router and see if it lists a URL for the BBB. On my router (an Asus) I go to 192.168.1.1 and enter the username and password for the admin account. Then I can see a list of attached devices. If your BBB is listed, then use that IP address for an SSH target. I presume it would listed at the first IP you listed, but you need to check. If your routerâ€™s subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, then that defines your network. So youâ€™re not likely to see something with an address like 192.168.254.1, because my router masks the first three octets (192.168.1) as the â€œnetwork,â€ù and only exposes the last octet as a list of host machines on that network. So you need to confirm that your BBB is actually on your network before trying to SSH into the thing.The other option is what Adam suggested: Connect it to your PC via the USB port, and then SSH in over 192.168.7.2. For example:$ ssh <a href=""mailto:tb@192.168.7.2"">tb@192.168.7.2</a>Hope this helps.TBEDIT: Maybe I didnâ€™t understand the original problem. I guess I should have started by asking: Have you connected the BBB to your machine directly (either the Ethernet port or via USB), or have you connected it to your LAN via the Ethernet port on the BBB? My answer above was based upon the latterâ€“that you connected the BBB to your local area network. If you instead are connecting the PC and BBB together via an Ethernet connection, then my answer would not applyâ€_because (of course) your router would know nothing about the BBB. So it would be helpful if you could elaborate on how youâ€™re connecting the two devices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zack,"Each OpenROV kit comes with a red beanie embroidered with <em>OpenROV</em> on the cuff. This is both practical and symbolic. The practical is obvious. A knit acrylic watch cap keeps your head warm whether you are headed to the bottom of the ocean in a manned submersible or making the morning coffee at home.Then there is the symbolic reason.For some the ocean is a mirror: a reflective surface on which we sail and swim and occasionally catch dinner. My father, an avid waterman, had me bodyboarding shortly after learning to walk and surfing not far behind that. It wasnâ€™t until I was 10 or so, when the family piled into the station wagon, drove to Key Largo, and joined the other tourists on a snorkeling charter, that I realized that the ocean isnâ€™t a mirror - it is a glass. I counted the days until I was old enough to get my SCUBA card. Looking through that glass has become the focus of my private and professional life.The hat is an homage to Jacques Cousteau. There have been many great sea explorers and adventurers, but nobody has done more to make the barrier between sea and air transparent as Jacques Cousteau. For him it wasnâ€™t enough to explore, he wanted to share what he was doing and why it was so important. Through a series of books and documentaries such as <em>The Silent World</em> and <em>The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau</em> he fundamentally changed the way a generation related to the sea and set the stage for how scientists and explorers relate to an audience.The hat also means you are part of the club. OpenROV is trying to extend this to the next group of explorers. In the same way that Cousteau brought the sea to our living rooms, you and I and our community can now bring the sea to everyoneâ€™s fingertips.

Or, if you donâ€™t want to bother with connecting cables to your computer, there is a community hack on Dozuki to build a <a href=""http://openrov.dozuki.com/Guide/How+to+build+a+WiFi+enabled+Tether+Management+System/59"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Wi-Fi enabled tether management system</a>.

This command can be run on OSX by pasting the line directly into the application Terminal.  The plot below shows the average (mean) RSSI reading from 4 different trials.

I used an area that was as free from obstructions as possible, but there were still some nearby metal buildings that could have had an impact on the signal.  Without a better idea of an acceptable RSSI, this information is not terribly useful.  However, this method could be useful in comparing different configurations or different Wi-Fi modules.

Iâ€™ve also had issues with the Tenda not connecting to the ROV even though the Wi-Fi still worked.  The connection issue only happened after I handled the board while putting the buoy together.  It is possible that I may have caused ESD damage to the electronics.  If the electronics are still all right, this may be able to be fixed by resetting the Tenda with the Tenda software.Future improvements include changing the battery holder and putting everything in a smaller enclosure.<strong>Bill of Materials</strong>The Bill of Materials below has links to places to purchase the materials I used for this project.

The problem being that most rivers I am looking to float in flow at 4-5 knots, and the open rov design only goes at 2 knots.  Based on a lot of googling and looking around there is nothing that is economical that can go over 2 knots.  So I have purchased the open rov 2.7 kit with the open design and going to figure someway to give it some boost.My ideas are as follows:look at replacing the existing thrusters with bluerobitcs t200 thrusters.  However with the delay and the price not sure if that would work.second idea is motifying the existing the frame, buy adding a second battery tube on either side.  I would mount extra thrusters to and power off the new battery bays.  As I do not want the options to turn the the additional thrusters on remotely, could not I not power the new thrusters from the new battery tubes and share the ESC that the existing thrusters are plugged into?Any help would be great.

badevguru,"As of the 2.6 version of the ROV, we have had lag issues in the camera. The 2.5 software eliminated most of the issues related to using computers that did not have enough processing power to drive video in the browser. We have however been left with a hardware based issue that exhibits itself as video freeze in high contrast lighting situations.  My current theory is that this is a result of several bugs and lack of DMA on the USB port of the beaglebone in the 3.8 version of the kernel we are using.  Dom managed to build a new image with a more recent kernel and the problem went away.My plan is to move the kernel used in the next release of the image. If you want to test the fix right now, it is rather painless to make the change.  Assuming you connect your ROV to a router or use another technique to get direct internet access from the ROV.SSH in to the ROV:1) wget <a href=""https://rcn-ee.net/deb/wheezy-armhf/v3.15.5-bone4/install-me.sh"">https://rcn-ee.net/deb/wheezy-armhf/v3.15.5-bone4/install-me.sh</a>2) chmod +x install-me.sh3) sudo ./install-me.sh4) sudo rebootThis installs version 3.15 of the kernel and appears to work well.### UPDATE July-22-2014 ####There is an issue that seems to require an additional configuration tweak with the new kernel. In some cases the O/S comes back up with the drive in read-only mode. This sometimes requires you to reboot several times before the system comes up correctly.  Codewithpassion has been busy and applied the following configuration change to try and take care of that issue.  I recommend doing the same and letting us know if you still see any problems related to having to do multiple reboots to get the ROV to come up again:SSH in to the ROV:5) sudo <span>tune2fs -o journal_data_writeback <span>/</span><span>dev</span><span>/</span><span>mmcblk0p2</span></span>-Brian",David_Murphy,"Great news, I just upgraded the kernel with no issues.

globallink,I am a newbie and just started the assembling of my OpenROV 2.6<br>\nI am concerned about the cementing of the endcaps to make sure they can withstand<br>\nthe water pressure. Since I would have to get it right on the first try and it would be<br>\ndifficult to seal it should it leak at 100m. In the instruction video it shows that the cable<br>\nentry is sealed with hot glue on the outside and with epoxy on the inside. Would it be<br>\nbetter to use epoxy to seal the cable entry on both ends as it flows better than the hot<br>\nglue. Any suggestions. tips or tricks on how I can do this right would be greatly appreciated.,Adam_Christensen,"The hot glue is only intended to act as a dam to stop the epoxy flowing out the other side and can be removed once the epoxy has set.  Just apply a good amount of hot glue around where the wires exit, then fill the whole feed-through with epoxy from the other side.  On the opposite end-cap you can use tape to cover the exit and get a nice clean finish (the tape will peel right off the epoxy once set.Other tips:",globallink,"thanks so much for the detailed info. I had already cemented the endcaps but it did not come<br>\nout that perfect with some airpockets. I just held it together by hand, as seen in the video but<br>\nI hope it will make a good watertight bond. If I heat up the epoxy, wont this reduce the working<br>\ntime until it sets? I also have a question about the motors which I had to disassemble and had<br>\nto remove the spring loaded lock washer on the shaft. Do I have to put this washer back on the<br>\nshaft which would be very difficult, on final assembly, or is the magnetic force enough to keep<br>\nthe motor and propeller in place",Adam_Christensen,"Warming up the epoxy will just make it less viscous, it is a great way to increase the working time and improve results.  If you are doing small fiddly jobs where you mix up a small batch, it really helps as you can just re-warm the epoxy any time it has started going off a bit and is to awkward to work with.  I almost never use epoxy at room temp anymore.As I understand it, for the 3 blade props there is no need to re-install the lock washer, but if you have a two bladed vertical prop it does need to be re-installed.",globallink,"Thanks so much. I have the 2 bladed vertical thrust prop, so I have to remove the motor to<br>\nreinsert the lock washer since I donâ€™t have the tool for it and the hole in the acrylic plastic<br>\nis too small to reinstall it. How comes the 2  propellers for forward thrust donâ€™t need it? donâ€™t<br>\nthey also go into reverse which could pull off the motors. What is the best way to protect<br>\nagainst salt water damage. Is WD40 the right treatment since I will use it only in salt water.<br>\nA question about the other endcap that has to cables. Should I use hot glue since it can be<br>\nremoved later to use it to install any additional or replacement wires.",Adam_Christensen,"From what I gather the two blade prop produces significantly more thrust than the three blade ones (they changed to this to improve the dive performance) and can pull the bell off the motor if not secured.Most people around here recommend using silicone lube spray for the bearings, before and after dives.I wouldnâ€™t consider using hot glue to pot the end-cap feed through, it is not strong enough and wont bond very well to the acrylic in any case.  Add some additional wires for flexibility if you like, I have the four for the IMU plus another 4 spare through my end-cap.  If you need to down the track you can always just buy another end cap kit, it is a lot cheaper than replacing all the bits that fail if the salt water makes its way into the e-tube.",globallink,"You are right, the hotglue is not strong enough, I wonder why the other endcap even has<br>\nthe cable hole and the video shows sealing it with hot glue. Do you know if there is a way<br>\nto get audio input, I like to connect a microphone. When soldering the motor wires to the<br>\nconnector which shows ESC-1 A B C, ESC-2 A B C and ESC-3 A B C, how to I know<br>\nwhich wire coming from the motor is A B or C since they are not labeled as such?",Darcy_Paulin,"Heat normally reduces the cure time of epoxy. It does also , with at least some epoxies, make it less viscous, but it shortens working time. I also heat up the epoxy as it helps get air bubbles out, both by thinning and by expanding the air bubbles. If you get it too hot though, it can suddenly cure up and form a skin on you. I use a heat gun, which does not heat evenly obviously. :D.",Adam_Christensen,"The order of the motor connections doesnâ€™t really matter too much as all it does is change the direction of rotation which can be reversed through the cockpit, but if like me you are a little pedantic, just solder them in any order, test them and if they are rotating in the opposite direction, swap any two leads for that motor and it will also reverse the direction of rotation.I presume they opted to keep the end caps the same to reduce the number of unique parts in the kit, that way the end cap pieces are interchangeable.  I think the instructions are intending to show the hole in the end cap being plugged with hot glue, to be filled with epoxy.",globallink,"But the motor has 3 wires so how would I know which 2 to swap. or is this a trial and error<br>\ntype situation. I try to get everything done correctly, so I donâ€™t have to start troubleshooting<br>\nany issues. Do you know if there is a way to connect a microphone, I would like to connect<br>\none to record audio with the video if there is a way to do that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the changes in 2.8 is that it will be pre-wired for external lights and an external servo, to save the user the work of modifying the Controller board to do so.  If you want to make your wiring fully compatible with OROV 2.8, hereâ€™s how to do so:The external light is powered by PWM3, and the external servo is controlled by D9 (Servo4).On your controller board, run a jumper wire from TP20 to PWM3+ on the headers.Run a jumper wire from TP21 to PWM3- on the headersTake a small piece of wire, and solder it between the two pads marked R32.  This will activate the PWM3 channel with battery voltage.Find an old servo and cut off the 3-pin connector and the accompanying 3-conductor wire.  Take the connector, make sure it will stretch on the controller from the test points to the servo outputs.  Wire the ground to TP25, the power to TP24, and the servo signal to TP23.  Plug this connector into position D9 on the bank of six servo outputs.If you havenâ€™t previously labeled the six grey wires, take an ohmmeter, figure out which wire corresponds to test points TP20-TP25, and label them accordingly.You can now seal up the electronics tube again.External to the ROV, connect the external lights (+) lead to the TP20 wire, the external lights (-) lead to the TP21 wire, servo ground to the TP25 wire, servo power to the TP24 wire, and the servo signal to the TP23 wire.

Paul_Willems,"ve been lurking a bit around here lately, but this is my first post. I do not have an ROV yet, but am considering it.I just wanted to contribute with something I was thinking of as a simple solution to be able to go deeper... theoretically, very deep. This is just an idea and may be utter rubbish, but maybe not. You decide.First, a little background of the idea. I am a rebreather diver and one of my simple rebreather kits in particular uses a principle that could be a simple solution to this problem. The unit is a SCR or semi closed rebreather that operates on the principle of a leaky valve with an over-pressure dump valve. The breathing loop is kept replenished by a small trickle of breathing gas fed at a constant rate. When a slight overpressure occurs in the breathing loop, a shoulder dump valve lets the excess leak out. Simple, and works great.So... for an ROV, rather than fighting the pressure differential, why not just compensate it on a similar principle. An ROV could carry a very small air tank that would gently leak into the pressure compartments; the paintball crowd have some very small, very high pressure tanks. A release valve that is calibrated to dump at a very slight overpressure would keep the internal pressure just a tiny bit above ambient at all times.One of the considerations in such a setup is that pressure varies very quickly with very minor ascents and descents. For a diver this means that depending on your orientation in the water, the dump valve can require adjusting during the dive. In my mind, an ROV is meant to keep a fairly stable horizontal position, so this is probably a non-issue. Another consideration is that of buoyancy. As an air tank slowly empties, its buoyancy will change quite significantly. This would make the neutrality of the ROV would change during the dive from negative at the beginning to positive during the end. The last consideration, is the sensitivity of electronics to pressure. I really don",Kurt,"Hi Paul,<br>I have also been toying with the idea of pressure compensation for dives, more for the prevention/detection of leaks than increasing the dive depth. I am considering a having a bicycle pump valve protruding from the main electronics compartment so that a hand pump could be used to pressurise the ROV from the inside before a dive. The pressure would have to be limited so as not to damage any of the components, especially the ICs or Caps where the cases are sealed. If there are leaks (from poor seals etc) then the internal ROV pressure will drop which could easily be detected by a pressure sensor on the inside of the ROV. Of course, this would only work until the water pressure is greater than the internal air pressure as then the water would leak in with no air coming out...Essentially, I think compensating for the pressure is a great idea, just be careful not to damage the electronics.",Eric_Stackpole,"ve also been very interested in learning about what pressures various components fail at.  In my mind, liquid compensation has always seemed very appealing.  Although it",Mike5,s funny I was just thinking this same thing the other day.  I was thinking along the lines of C02 canisters as well (paintball/gas type pistols).  In fact it would have the added bonus of acting to ensure you never have a fire on board your ROV as well (like if some wiring gets wet and shorts/arcs or a heat sink doesn,rentals,"Maybe this might work.

Achraf,"I have been struggling with the camera tilt for a while, the servo has always been buzzing at all times and sometimes the camera jumped up and down. See <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/servo-buzzing/1329"">here</a>.Until recently the servo stopped moving at all because the gears have stripped out. I am going to replace it next week but I am afraid the exact same thing will happen again.Is it possible to fix the servo problems from within the Arduino code? For example by detaching the servo from the pin once the tilt has finished or by not sending a PWM signal after a second or two? This would force the servo to stay in itâ€™s position without having to â€œadjustâ€ù if it encounters friction or weight problems.My arduino knowledge is very limited so I am not sure which library needs to be touched, I am assuming â€œCameraMount.cppâ€ù ?Thank you",badevguru,"If you are just hearing buzz on the servo, that appears to be an issue with the model servo we use that simply has a hard time getting to the exact position.  You can actually stick a servo tester on the servo if you want (removing our software from the equation) and you will still get the same behavior.  Yes, you could experiment with disconnecting the servo after moving it, but odds are the weight of the camera would start tilting the servo down.Note, that Iâ€™m not aware of anyoneâ€™s servo stripping due to the hunting pecking buzzing nature of the servo. The worst side effect is additional battery drain and the noise.  Typically the servoâ€™s get stripped when something blocks their ability to tilt.Perhaps someone else has ideas on servos that are a little more accurate?",Marco_Parenti,"tha same happens to me, is buzzing, for instance in its way down, so I just one click Q in the opposite direction and stop buzzing, the same in the top position of the camera. At first I thought it was keeping running al the time, but then Iâ€™ve tried taking apart the camera mount and stop the buzz. It is the weight of the camera mount, when you exert a very slight pressure at the servo horn  with your fingers the buzz start again. Iâ€™ve cleared the usb cable but is not much the difference.",Achraf,"So I replaced the broken servo with HS-82MG (the one with metal gears is supposedly a bit stronger)I greased the LED wires a little bit, I noticed they were rubbing against the hull with turning and they were getting stuck a little bit, the grease made them glide easily and didnâ€™t leave a noticeable trace.Now the camera tilt seems to be moving ok with no obstructions when everything is assembled; however I still have the buzzing sound.I tried to to disconnect the servo (unplug the cable) and it was able to hold the camera in place in all positions without needing to be powered on.Now, I only have to figure out where in the arduino code I can kill the power (or signal) of the servo when not needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But if the thing boots at least some times, then the power controller should be good I would think. So I would connect a serial debugging cable and see what itâ€™s showing on the times when the unit wonâ€™t boot. I think you need to see if thereâ€™s any sort of serial port indication when it doesnâ€™t boot.TB",lenny_m_baker,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/tcbetka"">@tcbetka</a> has a good first step. If you can see some sort of serial output from the Beaglebone, you know its getting power, just not completing the boot and it may reveal your problem. If you canâ€™t get serial information, start checking voltage along the path to the Beaglebone.I know it sounds like power should just be â€˜thereâ€™, but put a scope probe, if you have one, on the input to the LM25011 (or somewhere in front of it) and take a look at what your power source looks like when you turn it on. Power supplies take a relatively long time to ramp up their voltage when you turn them on, so be aware of that.If power into the LM25011 looks good, see if you can check the outputs of the LM25011. First, take look at the SW output (pin 9) and see if you have 5V there. You may need to catch it during power on. If you check it during steady-state it might look like a good, solid 5V, but the Beaglebone may not react well if the output acts funny during power up. Alternatively you could take a look at the Power Good signal of the LM25011 (pin 3). You can also get to that signal from the LM25011 side of R13.If everything looks good at the LM25011. then Iâ€™d start looking at the Beaglebone.If you do anything TB suggested or take a look at the voltage levels during power on, Iâ€™d be interested to know what you see.Hope this helps,<br>\nLenny",seangillen1887,"Hey Guys, Thanks for your suggestion, I apologize for the late response, Iâ€™ve been kept busy upgrading other parts of out ROV.<br>\nI wasnâ€™t getting any sort of serial response on non-bootups so I took a look at the voltage upon startup using a scope. It turns out there was a huge voltage drop when I introduced the load of the ROV. This sort of weird transience on the power supply must have been the problem, because when I try to power up using the actual batteryâ€™s I get a consistent boot every time.<br>\nIâ€™m not an expert in electronics by any means, but I assume this means my power supply is not able to source enough current? I was under the impression that 4A would be plenty, Iâ€™ve tried multiple power supplies so Iâ€™m fairly certain itâ€™s not just the case of a bad supply. On Monday Iâ€™ll hook the batteryâ€™s to a mutlimeter and see how much current draw I see when <em>they</em> provide power for a startup. Itâ€™s not super critical to me to have a consistent bootup from a fixed supply, but I am curious at this point.Thanks again for your help. Weâ€™re doing some pretty cool stuff with our ROV, Iâ€™ll be sure to post pictures when itâ€™s all said and done.",Adam_Christensen,"You are correct, the transient you are seeing on the power supply rail at power on is due to the power supply not being able to provide the inrush current of the ROV on powerup, which results in a brown-out on the BBB, apparently locking it up.  The inrush is primarily due to the ESCs, one option is to switch off the ESCs before powering up the ROV, you can then switch them back on one at a time once the ROV has started up.  This should prevent the problems you have been seeing.",seangillen1887,"I probably should have been more detailed in what Iâ€™ve tried. All the behavior Iâ€™ve described has been with the ESCâ€™s turned off. There may be some damage done to them (or some other part of the board) I once powered the board on a metal surface, shorting the whole thing for several seconds. This (I think) fried my home port adapter, but the ESCâ€™s still <em>appear</em> to work (motors still work) but that could be an illusion or some other component could have been damaged.",lenny_m_baker,"Hi Sean,Adam is probably right about the inrush browning you out, but 4A should be enough. When I do development I run with a DC power supply connected at my battery tubes, works great and shouldnâ€™t behave different than your setup. Do you have a current limit set on your power supply? That could cause the voltage droop if youâ€™re limited at something like 1A.Regards,<br>\nLenny",Walt_Holm,"Hi All:Iâ€™m coming late into this thread since I was out of the country for the last month.Powering the ROV off a benchtop supply can indeed be problematic, due to the inrush current required by the ESCs.  Turning the ESCs off wonâ€™t necessarily help this, since thereâ€™s still a big capacitor hanging off the power wires of the ESC, ready to pull down the bus voltage the instant you apply power to it.  If the battery bus voltage gets pulled below ~6V, the 5V power supply cuts out, which stops the controller boardâ€™s Arduino, which then resets the ESCs, which starts the process all over again.The 2.7 controller board attempts to ease this problem by slowing down the turn-on of the ESC power switch, MOSFET Q3.  On a 2.6 controller board, the ESC turn-on happens very fast and requires a very large surge current- it would not surprise me that a 4A supply is not sufficient.To get around this, if youâ€™re powering the ROV off of a bench supply, you can hard-wire the ESCs to be on by placing a shorting wire across J17 (ESC power switch). That way thereâ€™s no ESC inrush current after the 5V supply is brought up.  Just remember to take off this shorting wire once you switch to batteries, since the ESCs will be drawing power even with the ROV off.Let us know how things are progressing.-W",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Andrew_Parrella,"Hello,<br>\nI have good news! I had been struggling for months to get my version 2.5 ROV to work. The homeplugs refused to connect, despite lots of help from folks on the forum. I got frustrated and put it away for the winter.<br>\nSo this summer I decided to take another crack at it. I found a new tip in the forums about testing the homeplugs by connecting the ROV homeplug to my router and the topside one to my laptop. I fired up the ROV and there it was, the elusive center LED that I had been looking for. I could see the cockpit screen and everything. (No video, but one thing at a time, man!)So then I put the cables back where they belonged, and I realized that HEY the center light came back on! And I could see the cockpit! Maybe all this time they just hadnâ€™t been paired and couldnâ€™t find each other.<br>\nSo this is real progress.

Typically you allow for either rate or position commands. I dig the target orientation setting, however, if you have the CG and CB on top of one another, than the orientation hold is pretty easy, yet if you donâ€™t, that control law gets a little more complicated. Iâ€™ll give it some thought.",spiderkeys,"Yea, typically the orientation is also part of the position set of commands, since we are usually thinking about this in terms of pose and delta pose, i.e.:Pose:<br>\nx<br>\ny<br>\nz<br>\nphi<br>\ntheta<br>\npsiDelta pose:<br>\ndx<br>\ndy<br>\ndz<br>\ndphi<br>\ndtheta<br>\ndpsiIf we try and map the proposed commands, weâ€™ll see:RateOrientationPositionI think all bases are covered with the various API functions for affecting changes in these parameters with whatâ€™s listed here, from the point of view that all of these functions are simply ways of modifying the current setpoint (goal) of the currently active controller (rate vs position vs some hybrid controller). This of course beckons an API function for setting the control mode (to start off with, rate vs position).",Jim_N,"Ditto that. Iâ€™m curious as to how the set orientation maps to vehicle control, for example. Unless you have a moment-less vehicle configuration, holding a set roll pitch yaw may demand a more complicated control law for position hold. With your CG CB line, your moment will grow as a function of distance. Each vehicle and a different payload will affect the moment and adjustments would need to be made to the controller to compensate. Now this isnâ€™t a big deal as long as your controller has selected modes for the PID, i.e. PID for orientation, etc. You would just need to have a good control law that handles the rate adjustments. However, to much of a payload addition or change in the CG CB line moment would require a new controller more modification of the current controller via gains on the P/I/and or D. Not something Iâ€™d be to concerned about, but to be aware of.But controllers for this exist so rock on.",badevguru,"You can hold pitch and roll with elevons.

Iâ€™m not talking about the exploration or light intervention most people are familiar with. There is a specific problem that requires some heavier intervention and bigger toys to solve. While my partners and I are still in high school, we hope to begin development on a ROV that will solve this issue and even utilize modularity in the future.

Over time we hope to make it super easy, but for now there are still a couple of steps to make it work.If you run on a set of the batteries with everything else turned off, you can code a 6+ hours off of a full charge.  You can increase that by turning off power to the ESCs which is currently the â€˜â€™ key command in the OpenROV cockpit.When I am doing node development, I will pull the BBB off of the ROV and power it off of USB from my laptop.

badevguru,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/henry_stewart"">@Henry_Stewart</a> and I have been working on standing up the backend for a webrtc based video conferencing solution. Our goal is to tailor it for robot applications over time.WebRTC is a painfully immature technology, but it is moving fast and it is the only game in town with native built in browser support which is key for our OpenROV software stack.Most of the examples you see for webRTC based examples are setting up peer-2-peer connections which as super fast, but also require a direct connection between each participant in the conference. If you have 5 people on, that is 5X the bandwidth needed at each end point.We want to leverage this technology in the field where bandwidth is still likely to be a premium.  So we need a solution that only requires a bi-directional connection from the ROVâ€™s laptop in to the cloud.

Patrick2,"At OpenROV one of the improvements that we have been working on is developing new battery tubes. The most recent version uses a twist lock to keep the endcaps secured and the O-rings seated properly. This means that straps will no longer be needed and that the endcaps should always seal the battery tube. Additionally, by having the endcaps fully removable, they can be unmounted from the ROV and stored in a separate bags in order to keep the O-rings clean during storage.

My C++ is a little weak, but Iâ€™ll be sure to check it out!Brian - I am trying to use <a href=""http://socket.io"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">socket.io</a>. Would I want to create my own socket, or should I just communicate with sockets that already exist?",tcbetka,"You would create your own sockets (end points to communication) to communicate from your PC to the stuff running on the BBB, for instance. However since you arenâ€™t planning to use the BBB, then you will have to implement a socket connection to your Arduino. Another option might be serial communication to the Arduinoâ€_although that will likely be limited by the length of cable, and likely wonâ€™t be of much use to you. Also, in terms of <em>only</em> using the Arduino with your PC, I would definitely look at something that can give you a GUI on the PC. Qt would allow you to do thatâ€“and you could do it in C++, or (I think) Python. Iâ€™m not much of a Python guy, but I seem to recall seeing some forum threads where people have done a bunch of Qt-related work with Python.The problem that I see with using serial communication for the way you want to do this, is the length of the USB cable youâ€™ll needâ€“or the length of the UART wire needed. Youâ€™ll have to research it a bit more, but I am pretty sure that a USB cable wonâ€™t be of much use to you due to the length limitation they have. Last I heard it was like 20 feet or so, although I honestly havenâ€™t researched it in a while. And the i2c/SPI stuff isnâ€™t really meant to be long-distance either, as far as I know. So then it would seem as though you will indeed end up having to use sockets on the Arduino. I believe there is an EthernetServer class in Arduino that you can use, and simply connect an Ethernet cable from your PC to an Ethernet shield on the Arduino. Seems like that might workâ€“but then youâ€™d create sockets on the PC, and on the Arduino, and then communicate between those.Does MATLAB support the use of sockets? If so, and if you know how to make a GUI in MATLABâ€_then you wouldnâ€™t need Qt at all I guess. Iâ€™m just unfamiliar with MATLAB, so I canâ€™t really comment on using it to create and manage sockets.Here is a brief tutorial I found for using TCP sockets with Arduino. Thereâ€™s a bunch of stuff on it out there in Google:<a href=""http://evothings.com/doc/examples/arduino-led-onoff-tcp.html"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://evothings.com/doc/examples/arduino-led-onoff-tcp.html</a>",omahavaibhav,"Thanks for your help!

Your initial post made it seem that you wouldnâ€™t be doing that.I think you simply need to Google something like â€œMATLAB TCP socketsâ€ù as a start. For sockets on the BBB (Linux OS), youâ€™ll need to use something like the Node.js <a href=""http://socket.io"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">socket.io</a> library, or C/C++ socketsâ€_or even Qt-based TCP sockets.

Without this, a simple right or left turn (""yaw"") movement would just ignore the thrust level setting and use maximum power. This would trip the TrustFire batteries every time, causing a hard freeze.

Potentially a supercapacitor on the 5V rail which could power the Beaglebone for say about 10 seconds??  I understand it may need a resister to prevent too great a current on the inrush charging but this may overcome several of this style issue Thoughts,simon,"I know, the last post is rather old, but I wanted to comment on that.We had the same issue with our ROV 2.6 but with total blackouts when turning twice (one for each battery tube to die). Saline environment seemed to increase the issue. Therefore we potted the motors with epoxy and changed the Arduino code regarding the thrust factor while doing yaw motion. That solved the problem and we had no break down since then.An UPS for the BBB would be cool but most likely not work since the batteries need to be disconnected and reconnected to overcome the safety circuit shutdown. I am actually not sure but I would guess this is not possible to do when being submerged and without physically opening the tubes. Other than that, this wouldnâ€™t help with the overpowering issues since youâ€™d need to do it after every second turnâ€_",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought to just use two twisted pairs instead (and save the power an adaptor consumes) and a standard ethernet TCP-IP connection. I sealed 2 pair through the body and used hot glue to keep the pairs together every meter. Effectively I made a 20 meters patch cable. It sinks to the bottom without floats so you need a flat seabed. However I decided to increase the length and solder another 20 meters to the end. After soldering there was no signal anymore. The soldered joints will increase the impedance and increase the electrical magnetic interference EMI. Removing some twist from the cable also doesnâ€™t do any good.

The wire that makes up the windings are covered in enamel to keep them insulated. The ends are the only part where the enamel has been removed and as such can be soldered to.But at the end of Step 14 there is this line:Consider potting the motors because <strong>they are not waterproof</strong> at this point. <a href=""http://openrov.com/profiles/blogs/dst-70"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://openrov.com/profiles/blogs/dst-70</a>â€_Didnâ€™t step 9-14 already make the motor waterproof?

The ends that you cut and solder are not enamel coated so you must make a waterproof seal around the connection.The motor will function in water without â€œpottingâ€ù it.  However, it will probably last longer if you take certain steps to protect motor components, along with following the post operation cleaning and lubrication procedures.The armatures upon which the copper motor winging is placed is made of a ferrous material which is NOT coated, so it will corrode after a time.   The magnets inside the motor bell are made of neodymium which also corrodes rather quickly in the presence of salt water and other oxidizers.  Finally, the motor shaft bearings will corrode after a while as they are steel and difficult to clean.Here is what I have done in lieu of a full motor potting:   I sprayed a very thin coat of rustoleum crystal clear enamel on to the motor winding assembly and the same on the inside of the motor magnets.  I allowed this to dry completely.  I then assembled the motor parts and made sure that the motor would turn.  There was a small amount of binding so I lightly sanded the surface of the just coated motor winding in order to remove a small amount of the coating that I sprayed on.  This protects both the winding assembly and magnets from corrosion.The Bearings can be replaced with ceramic bearings that can be purchased at hobby stores or on-line.  Ceramic does not corrode.  The procedure for replacing the bearings can be found in these forums.A good procedure to follow for after operations is to thoroughly rinse the ROV &amp; run the motors for a couple minutes while submerged in a tub of clean fresh water in order to remove all salt water and dirt.  Allow the motors to dry completely and then spray the inside of the motor with a silicone based water disbursing lubricant.  This should be done after every day of operation.I have found that coating the motor winding and magnets with a light coat of crystal clear enamel and following the post operation cleaning and lube procedures prolongs the usable life of the motors.Hope this helps.",Brian_Grau,"We apologize for the confusion. <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/lenny_m_baker"">@lenny_m_baker</a> and <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/ronald_peters"">@Ronald_Peters</a> are correct with their posts.

First of all, the pressure range of the sensor is 300hPa - 1100hPa (0.3 - 1.1 bar).

I am a novice as far as the electronics and coding but imagine connecting the servo to those cables and any wiring on the boards would be similar to things done building the 2.7 from a kit and that I could copy the servo controls for the camera servo without too much effort.

Additionally where should I expect those 6 wires to be on the board?",lenny_m_baker,"Iâ€™m not familiar with the plug-in referenced above, but for the hardware youâ€™ll need to do a little work. You may want to see what the plug-in expects for a hardware configuration before modifying anything.With that said, I think youâ€™re on the right track. I believe what you need to do is trace your free wires at the end of the harness to whichever test points you want to use, e.g. 20, 21, and 22.The test point pads on the PWB are the end of your lines. Once you know which test points youâ€™ll use, I think youâ€™d solder wires to the test points and run the other ends to the servo connectors near where the ESCs and camera servo plug in. If youâ€™re a stock 2.7 right now there should be two available servo connections between the ESCs and camera servo connectors.Once you do that, the software needs to drive it. I think thatâ€™s where the plug-in would come into play.Hope this helps,<br>\nLenny",Walt_Holm,"Chan:You can download the schematic for the 2.7 Controller board off of our Github site.  Follow the tabs on the top of the page for OpenSource/Electronics.As Lenny says, the six spare wires terminate on the board right by the main connector, at the six test points marked TP20-TP25.  To hook up an external servo, youâ€™ll need to pick three of the spare wires. mark them as Ground, Power (BEC), and Signal, and then use a multimeter to see which test pads they are at on your Controller board.  Then you will need to run wires from those test points to the appropriate Servo Output pins.  As you mentioned, if you use a 3-pin servo connector (you can cut one off of a scrap ESC or servo), then you will be able to just plug this into one of the servo channel connectors.  Use the camera port (D11) if you donâ€™t want to write any new software, or you can use one of the spare ports (D9 or D10) if you want to write you own or use Dominikâ€™s plugin.Hope this helps.-W",chanchanval,"I would like to thank everyone for their help and tips.

noersetiawan,"Hello.Is it possible to use OpenROV image if I only have a beaglebone, usb camera, and ESC+motor? Currently I can control the motor and view the video from camera but of course the interface isnâ€™t convenient (still using python and VNC, Iâ€™m not a programmer), Iâ€™m looking to get web based interface. I donâ€™t have other sensor so I donâ€™t see the need to get other OpenROV component, only interested to use itâ€™s OS.Thank you.",tcbetka,"The problem with that approach, as I see it, is that youâ€™ll need to use the Programmable Realtime Units (PRUs) in the BBB, if you want any sort of predictable PWM control behavior. The Linux OS inside the BBB is not a â€œreal time OSâ€ù in the sense that the kernel isnâ€™t pre-emptive. So this basically means that if the kernel needs the processor and is doing something, then your code is not guaranteed to run in a predictable amount of time. The two PRUs on the BBB are what TI intends for you to use to give an independent means to â€œfarm outâ€ù the PWM controlâ€“so that the main CPU doesnâ€™t have to. And the problem with that, at least in my (limited) experience with the PRUSâ€_is that they arenâ€™t all that easy to program. LOL.So the other option is to use a peripheral microcontroller such as the Arduino. The BBB simply sends the Arduino a message to effect some change in the PWM signal, and lets the Arduinoâ€™s processor do the work. Itâ€™s still not â€œreal timeâ€ù because itâ€™s the same (non-preemptive) Linux kernel. However you only have to pass a few bytes of control data to the Arduinoâ€_and that shouldnâ€™t be a big deal. The other thing is that thereâ€™s only a single processing core in the BBBâ€™s CPU, so any time-slicing of work will still need to be run on the same processor. Contrast this with something like the new Raspberry Pi Generation 2 board, that has an ARM7-based quad-core CPU.Anyway, it might not be as easy as you think to do what you want. You also must use a camera that encodes the video on its ownâ€“like a Logitech Pro C920, just as an example. That does h.264 encoding, so the BBB doesnâ€™t have toâ€“which is a good thing, as it doesnâ€™t have a GPU (unlike the RPi which does).Hope this information helps clarify things for you, at least to the level of understanding that I have.TB",noersetiawan,"I see, thanks for the explanation. I can get myself an Arduino Uno, will that work? Also is there any subforum here or somewhere else you recommend which can help me about BeagleBone programming?

I havenâ€™t gotten my OpenROV kit yet (just ordered it yesterday) so I do not know the size of the Arduino binary codeâ€_ Uno only has 32KB for flash storage, and the Mega has 256KB. Not sure why they used the Mega, other than more serial portsâ€_and possibly more i2c buses. You need to ask someone more knowledgeable than I about the decision to use the Mega. I have both and generally use the Mega for stuff, but I am not sure why it was chosen for this project.Sorry.TB",tcbetka,"By the way, if you havenâ€™t already seen it, be sure to check out Derek Molloyâ€™s book â€œExploring Beaglebone Blackâ€ù (I think thatâ€™s the title). It is an AWESOME resource for the BBB unit. I read it 4-5 months ago when it first came out, and heâ€™s an incredible educator.

Richard03,I finished the build of my Openrov 2.7 and it came down to testing if it works properly. I used C size batteries and plugged it in and it was lacking power and the beagle bone would start to work then malfunction. Then I looked down and realized that the battery tube had moisture in it and it was hot to the touch and when I picked up my rov to move it to the cool floor the entire acrylic tube had melted and 2 of the batteries had then exploded.I wrote in and told the company of the issue and they told me it was because I had not bough the li-fe batteries. So I ordered them and waited 5 weeks for them to arrive and after I finished re building the battery tube. I just put them in and I didnâ€™t receive any power anywhere and the port tube instantly started getting hot.I need help to see where I had gone wrong.,Ronald_Peters,Could it be a short circuit or perhaps the polarity may be reversedâ€_  May want to double check the battery tube connections to the wiring harness to make certain that you have the correct leads connected to the (+) and (-) terminals of the battery tubes.   make the check,Richard03,I just checked it over and the positive and negative wires are installed correctly. I powered it up just now and was able to get onto the open cockpit for the first time and look around and test out the propellers but then the port battery closest to the positive terminal heated up again and it shut off.<br>\nSo Iâ€™m able to draw power to but not for long until it overheats. so I believe your right with the short circuit.<br>\nAnd I think that battery may have just been damaged in that short amount of time.,Richard03,I believe it was the battery tube adapters for the li-fe batteries.

And the third motor (treated was exposed to 0.05% bleach solution, fresh water rinsed, and then sprayed with lubricant (experimental <span class=""hashtag"">#2</span>).On the distilled water (control) unit I noticed only light oxidation on the armature frame and magnets of the motor and no corrosion on the copper winding, no corrosion on the bearing.   .   On the 0.05% bleach Experimental <span class=""hashtag"">#1</span>) unit I had heavy corrosion on the armature and corrosion/pitting on the motor magnets but no corrosion on the copper winding, moderate corrosion on the bearing.  On the Treated (experimental <span class=""hashtag"">#2</span>) unit which was pretreated with rustoleum enamel, I had no corrosion on any components.Since I did not apply rustoleum to the bearings I am assuming that the fresh water rinse and spray lubricant was sufficient to protect bearing assembly.The armature frame is probably composed of ferrous material, thus unless it is well protected it will corrode rather easily.  The magnets are probably Neodymium which is not very resistant to oxidation which would account for their rapid oxidation in presence of bleach solution (oxidizer) .My conclusion is that (clean)  freshwater rinse is absolutely necessary after each exposure to either fresh or salt water.  A water disbursal lubricant spray should also be reapplied after the fresh water rinse is completed.   The lubricant spray should be  compatible with motor &amp; ROV components.Pretreating motor windings with rustoleum crystal clear enamel in very thin coat(s) is effective in corrosion abatement of some components of the motors.  Since bearing assemblies can not practically be coated with enamel spray, fresh water rinse and lubricant is the only â€œpracticalâ€ù  measure of corrosion abatement for bearings.These suggestions are based on preliminary analysis of my experimental data/observations.A detailed report of experimental methodology and observations should be published on the OpenROV site by the end of next week.Hope this helps",Beckerp360,"Ceramic and SS bearings are available for these motors, Check with the local off road model car racers as they are always one step ahead of everyone else in this regard, They also rewind motors for more power and are familiar with how to treat for corrosion.",Darcy_Paulin,"Oh, I should have noted in the post that the new bearings are ceramic. <img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:"">  Hooray!That is a good idea to check with RC racers!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been using it quite extensively for my larger observation class OpenROV.With that, here are some other points to consider for your proposal:Tether drag and weight. Although stronger, that CAT5e cable you mentioned has a much greater diameter and will have considerable drag in any sort of current. You want the tether to be as thin as possible, while still having enough strength to be reeled in. I have reeled in my OpenROV with no problems with the stock wire.

You are going to lose A LOT of power over the tether itself. <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/walt_holm"">@Walt_Holm</a> is a better expert on power loss for tethers, but this is why batteries work well for observation class ROVs. Even larger OC ROVs such as the <a href=""http://hydroacousticsinc.com/products/rov-remote-operated-vehicles/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Hydroacoustics ROV</a> still use batteries. Frankly batteries are safer and less complex than a topside power source.The RJ45 IP68 connector. From looking at it and the specs, I would not recommend this connector if you intend to go deeper than 1m for any prolonged length of time. There are no pressure ratings on the spec sheet, so I would be wary of using it at any sort of depth.",Stretch,"Tether drag and weight.

Also, you will have to make your thicker cable neutrally buoyant, otherwise it is going to make your ROV negatively buoyant with the more tether you let out.Sorry Kevin but this simply isnâ€™t true.  First off, if current exists everything in the water will be equally effected.  Your ROV will be effected just as much as the tether.  Heck, even air bubbles and brine shrimp will be effected.  Where tether diameter will have an effect is when you try to tow that tether with the ROV.  The more drag your tether has the more power the thrusters will need to generate to over come that drag.  As for a negatively buoyant tether having an effect on the buoyancy of the ROV, that would depend upon the size of the rov and just how heavy that tether is.  If you find that its an issue, you can easily fix it by adding a small float a on the tether a short distance from the ROV.  That should counter what little effect the tether may have.As for tether strength vs tether diameter, thereâ€™s a reason why every commercial ROV in the world has a tether with a breaking strength of 1000+ pounds.  Do I need to say more?  <img  title="":wink:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":wink:"">",Scott_W,"s atmosphere, the atmospheric boundary layer is the air layer near the ground affected by diurnal heat, moisture or momentum transfer to or from the surface.

Hereâ€™s what happens:When you apply voltage over the ROV tether, battery power is applied to the +5V switching power supply, which turns on the Atmega 2560  (Arduino Mega) that is embedded on the controller board.  After this processor boots, it flips a switch which sends battery power to the ESCs.  If an ESC is shorted, it pulls down the battery voltage below ~6V, which stops the +5V switching power supply, which then stops the processor, which then opens the switch.  Lather, rinse, repeat.Unfortunately I have no idea whether your board can be salvaged by just replacing the BBB and the one ESC.  Iâ€™d fix the ESC first, and if that seems to work, then install and try the new BBB.BTW, the pulsing BRX LED is indicative of the Atmega chip sending telemetry to the BBB over a serial port, and means that the Atmega is up and running.  BRX = BeagleBone receive.Hope this helps.-W",milne50,"Thanks Walt, your explanation of the power switching scenario makes sense.i have a replacement hobbywing 18A esc ordered from hong kong<br>\n( got one of their program cards too - since it will pay dividends with configuring the ESC modes )assuming the new ESC sorts it, i will then proceed with extreme caution and check that the 5V and 3.3V are absolutely stable before replacing the BBB, i certainly donâ€™t wish to wreck another one.i will update in due course.regards<br>\nstuart",milne50,"wellâ€_ i managed to get a replacement Beaglebone black - waited for one to come up second hand on flea-bay but they were selling for not much less than new price so i just bit the bullet &amp; purchased new one to get things moving.  i have sold some other surplus stuff so â€˜swings and roundaboutsâ€™( if anyone is looking for a BBB in UK the best price currently seems to be from CPC Farnell Ltd. its the element 14 branded item , donâ€™t know if that makes a hoot of difference for openrov?  )With the utmost of care i flashed it with openrov image which took about 10minutes from 8gb micro SD card.

I may need do write a new extension tonight to go ahead and grab all of the details to help troubleshoot these reports <img  title="":wink:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":wink:"">.  In the meantime, here is a semi-quick guide for debugging the thrusters.  Please let me know if this helps in isolating what is going wrong.In the telemetry screen, there is one setting: Motor(1500,1500,1500) and another Mtarg(1500,1500,1500).  Where the numbers inside represent the value being sent to the thruster (Port,Vertical,Starboard).  Motor is the actual value that has been sent, Mtarg is the value the browser has sent to it. The values for the motors are between 1000-2000 where 1500 is neutral (stopped).  Technically these values are the PWM pulse widths in ms.There are two things that will cause a difference between Mtarg and Motor.Given your description I am curious what the motor values are when you are using the software.If the MTARG value is still 1500 on the port thruster when thrusting forward it indicates the command never made it to the micro controller which may mean the message was corrupted and rejected.If the MTARG value seems to be changing on both motors and the port motor is not spinning I would then check the MOTOR value. If it is still neutral (1500) then the firmware failed to send the command to the servo at which point I would check the value of the MTRMOD value in telemetry.MTRMOD stands for Motor Modification Value.  It is a floating point number that is multiplied to the target PWM value being sent to the motor.  When you reverse a motor in the UI it causes the MTRMOD value for the motor to be multiplied by -1, essentially flipping the direction.MTRMOD(1,2,1,2,1,2) where the values are (Port Forward, Vertical Forward, Starboard Forward, Port Reverse, Vertical Reverse, Starboard Reverse).I would basically be checking to ensure none of the values are zero.If the MOTOR values seem correct and the thruster is still not turningâ€_ well then we have a bigger mystery as we are properly sending the right signal to the ESC.

fridgefish,"Hi,<br>\nIâ€™m really a beginner when it comes to ROVs and hardware (I prefer to code if I have a choice), so please bare with me.<strong>TL;DR:</strong> Whatâ€™s a relatively easy to use &amp; maintain, low cost, goes in salt water solution for ROV motors?So, Iâ€™ve been researching motors for ROVs, and the ones used in OpenROV. The problem is, from what Iâ€™ve read, brushless DC motors (like the ones you use) are really complex and expensive to control (with the ESCs and everything). I know that servos are very easy to control, and so are regular DC motors: <em>but I canâ€™t find any servos or regular DC motors that would be strong enough to power an ROV.</em><br>\nIâ€™ve heard you can also use bilge pumps as motors.<br>\nAny ideas on what I should do?Sorry if this is in the wrong category, feel free to move it c:",fridgefish,"If it helps, Iâ€™d like to do this with an Arduino Uno R3 hooked up via serial to a BeagleBone Black, but Iâ€™m open to suggestions.",Ronald_Peters,"A lot depends upon the depth (pressure) at which you intend to operate your ROV.  If you use bilge pumps for motors this factor becomes critical.  Most bilge pumps are water resistant by means of bushings and seals which keep water from entering through the shaft opening.  Pressure at significant depth can cause these seals to fail or to deform and bind the shaft.   Much work has been done with magnetically coupled drive units where the motor is absolutely sealed from outside water environment.  These can be purchased or even manufactured by the hobbyist with some technical and mechanical skill &amp; the proper tools.   Magnetically coupled thrusters could theoretically be powered by regular DC motors.  However, I feel that brushless motors will offer better control and variety, as well as more durability.  If you look on-line at e-bay you will find that you can usually purchase ESC/Motor combos at a reasonable price.As to the issue of water/corrosion proofing the motors,  I have found that the brushless motors are easier to condition for corrosion abatement.  If you separate the motor bell from the armature/winding, then coat the armature with a â€œthinâ€ù coat of enamel clear coat paint (rustoleum crystal clear) this process works very well.   In adition to this, it is equally important to thoroughly rinse the motors in fresh water after each run and spray a silicone based water disbursant lubricant in to the motor after each fresh water rinse.   It sounds like a lot, but really it is quite easy to do.Good luckâ€_",fridgefish,"Hi Ronald,<br>\nAwesome post! Thanks for the help.How deep would a bilge pump go? I guess it varies, but would it break below 50m? Iâ€™ve looked at a guide and they said they were â€œhoping the bilge pumps would go about 10m down,â€ù so Iâ€™m pretty sure they wouldnâ€™t go past 50m.<br>\nAre the motors you use for OpenROV 2.7 magnetically coupled? Or are they just regular brushless DC motors?I agree with you about the durability of brushless motors. I read a forum post here that said they had better durability because of less moving parts. Generally, are brushless motors more powerful than brushed ones? I did a little search on Google and found several links to brushless motors with an ESC (some are even waterproof!) on Amazon.Also (sorry for tons of questions), would a servo motor like <a href=""http://hitecrcd.com/products/servos/waterproof-servos-2/hs-5646wp-high-voltage-high-torque-programmable-digital-waterproof-servo/product"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">this one</a> be powerful enough?Thanks for the tips on the waterproofing of the motors.",Ronald_Peters,"Here is a link to a Homebuilt ROV hobbyist (<a href=""http://www.homebuiltrovs.com/howstarted.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.homebuiltrovs.com/howstarted.html</a>)   They have built several units using both bilge pumps and also they have a design for a homebuilt magnetically coupled thruster.   Right now, the OpenROV uses brushless motors.  Some have modified their OpenROVâ€™s to use more powerful commercial thruster units.As far as â€œpowerâ€ù goes, the power comes from both the combination of the prop and the motorâ€™s ability to turn the prop.  There are a number of websites available on-line that deal with optimum prop design for specific applications, marine engineering, etcâ€_   The good folks at OpenROV have done some experimenting and testing of various combinations of motors and thrusters and I believe they have come up with a great setup for Hobbyist built micro Observation Class units.If you are dealing with small ROV design then many components (motors, props, controllers, etcâ€_) are readily available through Hobby stores that specialize in radio controlled boat models.ROV thrusters (as with all thruster applications) are typically designed to provide sufficient thrust for operations in a particular environment.   For example, are you operating in fresh or salt water, what depth, what degree of control you need and will there be significant flow (current) in the water column.More often than not small observation class ROVâ€™s are low to moderate powered because they are likely to operate in areas that do not have swift moving water or strong current.  However, there are some applications where a small ROV would have need of a more powerful thruster combination.  More powerful thrusters often cost much more money so most times people build to suit their intended operational need.  Think of it like this, If you had an old VW car and intended to only run it around town and at low to moderate speeds then it is likely that you would equip it with an inexpensive stock four cylinder motor (most economical option).  But you almost surely would not spend thousands of dollars more to equip it with a 500 hp race motor,  unless you intend to race it.Another consideration is power supply.  This factor will also impact what motors can be used for thruster system. Are you using onboard batteries or surface supplied power?  Will you be running a 10 to 12 volt system, 18v, or something significantly higherâ€_Then there is the issue of motor control.   If your ROV is going to be digitally controlled by onboard computer then you will need a motor that is compatable with available ESC.These are just a few considerations when selecting the best fit thruster for your project.",fridgefish,"Hi Ronald,<br>\nThanks so much for your help. I always thought it was <em>just</em> the motors power not the design of the propellor to. Iâ€™ve had a look at the homebuilt ROVs site and they do have some pretty good resources there.<br>\nYour example of the VW car was helpful, thanks c:Iâ€™ve been searching around and found a ton of brushless motors (some without their own ESC included). Are all motors compatible with all ESCs? Like, if I bought Motor A would I have to hunt down a specific model ESC for Motor A? Or could I just buy a random one off Amazon or something?If you have any specific hobby shops that you recommend for low-powered hobby motors thatâ€™d be nice.<br>\nAlso, what would you recommend in terms of power supply? I was always going to use on-board batteries, but should I do the power from the surface?Thanks again. (sorry to bug you with all these specific questions)",Ronald_Peters,"The selection and matching of ESC to Brushless motor is dependent on several factors.  When I have purchased brushless motors, I have usually gone with combo packs where the manufacturer has bundled the ESC, Motor and sometimes a programming card in one package.  That way I can be sure the components all work well together.  However, it is not always necessary for you to do it this way.   Again, since we are dealing with small scale units we can defer to the scale model hobby.   I have found several good articles that address pairing motors to ESC.  here is a link to one of them.  It also addresses (to some degree) the issue of power source:   <a href=""https://www.hobbywarehouse.com.au/articles/how-to-match-esc-motor-lipo-battery-rc-car.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.hobbywarehouse.com.au/articles/how-to-match-esc-motor-lipo-battery-rc-car.html</a><br>\nIf you want to research further you can do a google search with something like â€œHow to match ESC with brushless motorâ€ùThe power source is like selecting the appropriate thruster for the ROV.  We think of it in terms of what we need and what is the â€œbest fitâ€ù for our needs.   Some folks have been experimenting with providing power through ethernet or other similar arrangements on their OpenROVâ€™s.   Others run a separate power feed along side (or as part of ) the tether.If you want a small, compact and portable ROV that you can use anywhere, then onboard battery power is perhaps best suited.  Keep in mind that all onboard systems must be designed to operate on the available battery power and should be designed for max energy efficiency.   Also, you may want to keep an extra set of batteries available with you on site.The larger ROVâ€™s normally run on surface supplied power (often rather high voltage) or a combination of battery and surface supplied.  This has the advantage that you donâ€™t need to change out the batteries when they run low.  However, you always need to have a constant power source nearby to tap in to, which limits your operational location somewhat.Iâ€™m currently using the Li-FePO4 batteries.  Six of them in two stacks of 3.  The advantage is that they provide relatively long (2 hour or more) duration per charge.   They do require some special handling and safety considerations, but they work well for this application.  Others have tried different batteries with success.  A good explanation of battery discharge characteristics can be found here:  <a href=""http://www.mpoweruk.com/performance.htm"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.mpoweruk.com/performance.htm</a>   Selection of batteries requires several considerations including (but not limited to) available space (size), power &amp; performance, requited voltage, cost, safety, etcâ€_Hobby stores are abundant.  It is difficult to recommend a particular one.  I usually shop at Amazon or e-bay.  Iâ€™ve purchased from HobbyKing,  Tower Hobbies, RC mart, to name a few.   For electronics and onboard computers I have used DigiKey, Cables and Kits, Granger, Edmund Scientifics, RobotShopâ€_Hope this helps.",fridgefish,"Hi Ronald, sorry for the very late reply!

Paul_S,"Hello Everyone!<br>\nMy name is Paul and I lead a group of undergraduate research students at California State University at Channel Islands. The team is a division of Dr. Sean Andersonâ€™s Pacific Institute for RestorATe Ecology (PIRatE) laboratory, called the Aerial and Aquatic Robot Research team (AARR). We have been building OpenROV units over the past year for the purpose of marine ecology research. We have recently returned from our first major deployment of OpenROVâ€™s on Santa Rosa Island, off the coast of Santa Barbara, CA.&lt;img src=â€™/uploads/openrov/4783/5852be7e8df46111.jpgâ€™At first we were nervous about such an inexpensive and user created solution for performing oceanic research. Comparable systems cost 10 times the price, and unfortunately out of the reach of our funds. The OpenROV 2.6 units had a lot of problems with the motors, and we had concerns with durability. The new 2.7 unit has been so much more robust in just about every arena and has been a great tool. With just a few tweaks we have repeatedly and consistently collected data.The team is finally getting settled back into repair, design and build mode after spending a combined three weeks deploying ROVs on Santa Rosa Island, where our Research Station is located. The total combined deployments has given us a total of over 120 dives. We are working on two research projects, a Marine Protected Area health study, and a subtidal/intertidal ecology study. The majority of the dives were done with our two transect duty 2.7 OpenROVs: The Remote Underwater Mariner (RUM) and the black Pearl. Weâ€™ve learned quite a bit from using them on such regular intervals.Lessons learned:The motors need to have a strain relief on the copper windings to prevent breakage of the wire and subsequent shorting.<br>\n<strong>We used hot glue to better attach the windings to the rear of the stator, avoiding getting glue on the rotor and interfering with the motor mounts.</strong>The ROV should always be slightly positively buoyant, we use the hold depth function which works great for running transects.<br>\n<strong>On one of the last 60 meter transects, our ROVâ€™s tether became completely and utterly tangled in kelp due to heavy surge. Harsh conditions and attempts to pilot out of the tangled mess resulted in the tether being severed at 30 meters from the launch site, because the ROV was slightly positively buoyant, we were able to retrieve the ROV!</strong>The out of the box balancing of our ROVs needed to have some ballast adjustment because of the tendency to pitch forward on straight transects.<br>\n<strong>The video transects we perform require a higher quality video, so we use two GoPro cameras, a forward one and a downward facing one. We mount them on a 3D printed rail system that I designed, with PVC skids for protection (the side outrunners are for the intertidal system.) The rail allows for adjustment of position for balance and ballast. Some additional high density closed cell foam floats from fishing nets were used to offset the weight, and provide more buoyancy in the rear.</strong><br>\n<img  width=""300"" height=""208"">The topside adapter boards need to be fully sealed off. One of ours died due to corrosion from sea water splash, and moist conditions.<br>\n<strong>We have a small pelican box with a battery powered wi-fi access point, the wires pass through holes we drilled and then filled with hot glue. This enables us to connect by wi-fi to the ROV using our toughbooks, with all of the ports sealed.</strong><br>\n<img  width=""300"" height=""225"">Two absolute necessities for repeated deployments are a tether management reel (a commercially available slip ring works well to allow the spinning) and if working in uncovered areas, a laptop shade!<br>\n<img  width=""300"" height=""219"">The payload rail system needs a few more adjustments, but we will be posting the 3D models for people to use, as it has been a great use for mounting payloads on our units!See and read more on our blog at <a href=""http://csuciaarr.wordpress.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://csuciaarr.wordpress.com</a>",Stretch,"Good idea to make the ROV slightly buoyant, besides a snagged tether if the ROV has any sort of failure it would (hopefully) return to the surface (eventually).",Jim_N,"Great post, stories like these are what keep us going!",Marius_Antares,"Great Work Paul!

Daniel3,"We have successfully programmed and calibrated the motors, but the motor on the starboard side spins slower. Meaning that it maxes out at lower rpms than port and comes to a stop faster. Any idea what could cause this?",Walt_Holm,"d try recalibrating the ESCs one more time, and also carefully examining all the solder joints around the ESCs, making sure that there are no shorts.- Finally, you can try swapping ESCs between the motors.  Unfortunately this requires some soldering.  What you could do is swap the port-starboard wiring at the DB-25 connector, re-power the unit, and then see if the starboard motor is still slow, or whether the slow motor is now the port one.  If it",Daniel3,"Thank you for your reply, Walt.We have reprogrammed the ESCs a few times since your reply and now all of the motors are spinning at the same velocityâ€_without commands.

The behavior you reported is consistent with this bug.<strong>The quick workaround</strong> is to enter and exist the diagnostic screen using the arrow in the top left of the diagnostic page to close the diagnostic window.  Then go back in and try calibrating the motor.  This has a good chance of resolving the issue and I would try this first.The latest BETA software has a fix for the issue that would eliminate needing the work around.

Scott_Calhoun,"Hey ROVers,Just finished my 2 year adventure getting a OpenROV Version 2.4 built.I was too far into the design when I found out about the servo being under powered for the design.I could not go for the chassis re-design (which was quite elegant) so I opted for the â€œletâ€™s throw more power at the problem approachâ€ù. I replaced the original v2.4 servo HS-81 with a HS5085-MG and also replaced the plastic horn with an aluminum one. I then sanded down the chassis everywhere that was providing resistance with the tube and made extra sure that the alignment on the servo horn was such that the electronics sort of â€œfloatsâ€ù in the tube. The wire harness provides most of the resistance but the power of the HS5085-MG easily overcomes thatâ€_or so I thought.The design has worked great in test dives except I have locked up the servo - twice. I replaced it thinking that I had burnt it up but the second one locked up yesterday in a test (after 3 successful test dives) and I know I checked to make sure that the chassis was floating when I sealed the tube.My question isâ€_are the servos dead?I have read about buying a HiTec programmer to reset to factory defaults and I disassembled one of the servos to verify that the servo gears were physically jammed by something.I will gladly spend the $60 for the programmer if I know that it will restore my servos.Any help would be greatly appreciated.â€“jscott",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work would simply be to map the socket.io messages to ROS topics.  That said, you can of course go the other extreme and bypass all of the OpenROV software if you really want to and load the firmata sketch on the Arduino and talk to the serial port directly.  -Brian",Robert_Codd,"d be happy to help document the Controller Board API but there is still a large number of status messages returned from the board that I have not figured out yet."")",Robert_Codd,"Also future integration with ROS would be eased by upgrading the base ubuntu image to 14.04 LTS, the long term service release being a bonus.",badevguru,"Oh man, well...For several reasons, the base distro that we are supporting is Debian.

Stretch,Does OpenROV support control of more than 3 thrusters?  Looking at the main control board schematics it appears that it doesnâ€™t.  Can anyone confirm?

If I used 6 I wouldnâ€™t have any servo controls for the camera tilt, so I may limit the design to 4 or 5 thrusters.Iâ€™m guessing that if I used more than 3 thrusters I would have to re-write the control firmware / software in order to control them, correct?",Walt_Holm,"Yes, you will need to modify the Arduino code in the processor on the control board, plus potentially write JavaScript software as well to add whatever extra user-interface channel is necessary.Youâ€™re not the first person looking to do this, so I suspect that within a few software releases there will be something in the stock software for this.-W",Stretch,"Thanks Walt!

Skambest,"I have been asked by Open ROV to share my experience with my new OpenROV 2.7.I assembled my ROV and vacuum tested it, -0.5bar for 30 min â€“ All OK.  After this I ran it in my bathtub. All worked well and as expected. I was unable to do more tests on functionality since IÂ´m waiting for the battery chargers to arrive.After seeing this video - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRo79IMExUQ"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRo79IMExUQ</a> and especially this one: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C72epQ2djUk"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C72epQ2djUk</a>, I felt it safe to try my ROV to 90m.I decided to do a real life pressure test at sea, so I removed all electronics and batteries. I had 3x30m of line for this test. My dive computer and a led weight was attached to the hull. The led weights were needed to make the ROV slightly negative buoyant.First test was to 30m. All well and no leaks.  Second test was the full length 90m. I was very surprised when I pulled it back to see that is had imploded completely both main tube and both battery tubes. The implosion of the main tube was so powerful that it ripped apart the whole structure. Absolutely all acrylic part except from the battery end-caps with the O-rings was broken, including the ROV hull?!I have taken some pictures of this. When reviewing the log on the computer I could see that the decent from the surface down to approxâ€_ 60m were slow and fine, but after that the speed increased rapidly. This indicates to me that the implosions happened at 60m.The battery tubes werenâ€™t actually imploded. They where squeezed flat and ruptured along the squeeze line.I contacted OpenROV support, and they quickly replied â€“<br>\nâ€œSounds incredible! Iâ€™m guessing that the implosion of the battery tubes occurred around 60m which made the ROV sink faster to implode the main E-Tube. With batteries inside the battery tube, itâ€™ll prevent the battery tubes from imploding at that depth and should be stable beyond the E-Tubes failure point. We would love to see and hear what you found out through this test on our forums. That being said, we can send you the replacement parts that you need in exchange for a forum post of your test! Itâ€™s always helpful to hear these things.â€ùExcellent support, thanks!In the after math of this one could say that I should know that the battery tubes needed some support inside before this test could be done, but after seeing the last video I thought I was safe. In that test there is no extra support in the battery tubes.

Bulkheads are key for structural support.   Even the electronics tube will garner some benefit from the plexiglass structure of the chassis inside if/when its starting to compress.   The early cave diving canister lights were made from PVC and acrylic, not so dissimilar from what we are doing here and needed the batteries (or proper size) in place so they would not leak or implode. Current ones are Delrin and have bulkheads built into the battery/battery housing.  The  same with underwater scooters of certain designs (when they started using large PVC tubes) needed a battery carriage that functioned also as an internal bulkhead structure so that the cylindrical hull would not deform enough to loose seal and flood.",Darcy_Paulin,"In the second video, there were supports inside the battery tubes, but they were clear tubes so you canâ€™t see them easily (or perhaps at all). I was expecting them to fail at some point since the test was very deep, so I didnâ€™t want to put my batteries in. Sorry that I didnâ€™t make that clear.The second camera died, or you would have been able to see the regular unsupported battery tubes bunch up in their elastic band, like a handful of pick-up sticks.I have pondered why the endcaps did not fail until so deep (in a previous test, Endcaps, of a similar thickness but different layout, popped at around 100m). In this test I had o-rings sandwiched between the endcap and the rim of the tube. I Still donâ€™t know, but I suspect that the o-ring may have allowed the endcap to flex and slide where a hard edge might have acted the a sharp cutting edge. Immediately before the cap finally fails, you can see the o-ring slip out around the cap. I think it could have gone further if the o-ring was held in place.

The drawback would be the low amount of backscatter in fairly clear water, and the interfereing light inside the system.",Ken_Gaines,"The lack of backscatter would be very telling in terms of primary productivity. Clear water in a natural environment is actually an indicator of a weak primary producer population (i.e. algal cells, diatoms, rotifers, other plankton, etc). In other words, the clear water would indicate low chlorophyll content and therefore low primary productivity.As for the interfering light, I agree with you completely, the answer here would be to place a shield between the receiver and the emitter blocking them from light emitted by the ROV...or you could just turn the lights off while making a measurement.",Sciencemike,"Yes you are right.

I have a camera that is specially modified to allow IR light to reach the imaging sensor. The red channel is replaced with the NIR band light to allow detection of ground vegetation in geo-referenced imagery using this equation:NDVI =(rNIR - rVIS)/(rNIR + rVIS)You can also use the blue channel reflectances in a similar way to locate water on the ground using the NDWI analysis:<span>NDWI = (rho(0.86 mu m) - rho(1.24 mu m))/(rho(0.86 mu m) + rho(1.24 mu m))</span>In reading the paper again, I have come to the conclusion that the chlorophyll detection technique they use could probably be used with the same NIR reflectance as used in NDVI analysis.

The traces were beefed up a bit when the 2.7 revision of the board came out, but they are still not really suitable for motors.  So if youâ€™re going to mount the motors on the board (say, piggybacking them over top of the existing ESCs), and are going to mount the ESC outputs into the holes for TP21-25, I would add some additional wires on the bottom of the board, running between TP21-25 and pins 21-25 of the DB-25 connector.

The new ESCs used on the 2.7 seem to be working much better than the units that we had on the 2.6, and if you get the board with the ESCs preinstalled, they also come pre-programmed and pre-calibrated.Before plugging in a new controller board, Iâ€™d make sure that you carefully examine your wire harness and the starboard motor.

Henning_Roth,Can I connect a hydrophone to the ROV so I can listen to the audio  on my connected<br>\nlaptop?,badevguru,If you search for hydrophone you will find several protects where people are working on making low cost versions for OpenROV.The later versions of the ROV have spare wires that can be used too hook up just about any payload you want.Software needs to be written to have the beagle bone take the audio and send it top side and there is a preview of such a plugins floating around in the forum as well for the built in camera mic.If you do find one and get it mounted be sure to share.   If you need help with connecting the software I am always happy to help.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a 24-hour hack-a-thon, out here in Livermore, myself and two colleagues endeavored to design and test hardware and software; supporting a CTD+ sensor suite, targeted for our ROV projects. It was intense, it was fun, and we mostly succeeded in developing a prototype environment for the sensor suite and software framework needed by citizen science aficionados.A CTD is a Conductivity, Temperature, Depth sensor system used in marine science to track, you guessed it, salinity, temperature, and depth during scientific expeditions and environmental monitoring. The + on the end of the CTD symbolizes the extension of the standard sensor suite which is typically found on buoys, ROVs, and other marine platforms. Though our hack-a-thon results cover only the LTD component (L= ambient light), the framework allows for any number of additional sensor and actuators (pH, water sampling, hydrophones, etc) to be easily added to the package.Why didn\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a risk that you might damage the circuit board in the process of drilling.On the other hand, the air pocket you show here is really quite small and you would probably have to go quite deep to see a pressure differential great enough to shatter the IMU case at that point.If it were me, unless there is some other obvious flaw that would allow water to migrate in to the IMU circuit board, Iâ€™d just operate it â€œas is.â€ù",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
