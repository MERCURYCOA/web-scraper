One of the three pins on the connector is not connected to anything, but that pin on the vehicle is used for charging the batteries.Keep in mind that if the tether is extended very far beyond 100m (maybe over 120m or so) it will start to have trouble delivering enough power to support the topside, especially durring startup. We‰Ûªve been considering an adapter that could supplement power to the topside to allow (much) longer tethers, and I‰Ûªd love to gauge how much interest there would be in that sort of a thing.Best of luck with your project- please let us know what you‰Ûªre aiming to do!Eric"

oddgeir,"             2018-04-01 21:14:31 UTC           ","HiI just received my Trident, and been using it for a few days now. Right now, the only way to control it, is via an android app. This app is still in it‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏbaby stage‰Ûù but is working quit nice. From what I have red they are working with upgrading and expanding this app with new features. They are also planing to make an app for ios, and I just saw an ad for an ios developer.I have not seen anyting regarding a windows app, but hopefully some one from the OpenROV team can answer that.My recommendation is to go for the JXD Singularity, then you have an all in one controller, with minimum start up challenges. You can buy this from openrov or directly from China via ebay. I bought mine from China, this is the cheper alternative, but comes with a small risk of geting a unit that is not working as it should. (According to some YouTube reviews, there have been some that has defects, hopefully they have improved on there internal controls). Mine was working as it should.If you buy it from openrov, they have preinstalled the app, and made shoure it is working as it should.My next step will be to connect video goggles to the JXD to eliminate the problem with sunlight on the screen. But form what I have seen so far, is that it‰Ûªs important to learn to control the Trident, before you start to use video goggles. Because it take some practice to know where you Trident is‰Û_I was also focused on using a laptop with a Bluetooth controller, but that was before I got to try it.The JXD also can fit in the hard case.C1AE6423-13FC-42F8-B5E3-B4918F3CF0AC.jpeg4032x3024 2.02 MB"

marcolinger,"             2018-04-04 17:03:47 UTC           ","I confirm, the JDX (bought directly from Openrov with the Trident) is a pefect choice. The app is working fine but there is certainly a lot of room to improve it, mainly to give the possibility to register in high resolution onto the memory inside rhe Trident.For me, the only problem is that you see nearly nothing on the screen when you are near the sea and have a bright sun. This is not a problem of the JDX and will not be diminuished by another screen. I used my anorak to cover my head and the screen in order to get a darker environment. This works but is not particularly nice when it is hot ! The best solution are probably dji or similar googles.As the Sardinian sea in our place get deep only verry far from the coast, I used the 100 meter lenghts but went only to 2,20 meter deep. I had no problem at all with the orientation. Once you understand how works the compass indication it is prettyEasy.An important recommendation is to clean with attention the motor compartiments. In mine I had a lot of fine sea sand. Also the salted water has to be removed carefully (not know how to do this with the central propellor ?).Conclusion : a perfect product ! I really do not regret my investment."

If you do not want to buy the Openrov solution, take a non expensive android tablet. This will do a good job at a low price. The only disadvantage, based on my experience, is that you will probably be a little less precise in the guidance of the rov as you don‰Ûªt have well calibrated joysticks."

If you wouldn‰Ûªt mind emailing these descriptions to our support team (support@openrov.com) we can track the issues through our system. In the meantime, the basic things to double check are signal quality (make sure there is a good radio path between the WiFi Topside and your device, and that there isn‰Ûªt a lot of other interference on those frequencies like lots of other WiFi or Bluetooth devices). Also, sometimes video can cut out if the battery level is very low, so it‰Ûªs good to double check that your battery isn‰Ûªt almost dead.Presuming it isn‰Ûªt either if these issues, Support is probably the best route to go so we can get more hands-on.Thanks again for reporting this stuff back!Eric"

charlesdc,"             2018-03-29 22:16:47 UTC           ","Hi @julianlaurence,Most of the videos we have posted on the website were using the 1080p stream from Trident, which is why they generally look better than 720p recordings that users have been posting.Trident has two video streams: one at 720p30, which is optimized for transmission over wifi to achieve low latency and reduce lost frames (and thus has lower visual quality), and a 1080p30 stream which is optimized for high quality footage. The bandwidth requirements for the 1080p video are generally too high to deliver a reliable piloting experience, so that stream is designated to be recorded to internal memory on Trident, and downloaded later after the dive. We record the 720p video live on the user‰Ûªs mobile device so that they have an immediately reviewable video, or a backup in case the Trident is somehow lost before they can sync the HQ video. In the currently deployed Beta software, the onboard recording feature has not yet been released, so the videos being posted are from the 720p stream, which is lower quality and can have missing frames.I uploaded a recent dive that @codewithpassion and I did earlier in the year using an alpha version of the onboard recording software. The quality of the camera has been adjusted such that it is better than what you see in the shark and seal videos:The onboard recording feature is almost ready and will be deployed as an update in the near future."

If you are experiencing this problem follow these steps:(1) Make sure you have the latest OpenROV Cockpit App.-connect your device to the internet, head to Google Play, find the OpenROV App page and update should be available if there‰Ûªs one(2) Once you‰Ûªve got the latest app, connect your device to  your Trident WiFi (make sure your batteries are full on both the device and Trident) and open the app as usual.(3) Head to the ‰ÛÏMaintenance‰Ûù screen and check for update in the top left. You may have done this before but try it again anyway as we are constantly working with our service provider to fix things as they come up.(4) Give it some time‰Û_maybe as much as 60 minutes. If you notice that things aren‰Ûªt seeming to change on the update screen, try closing (not just minimizing) the app and reopening the app and checking for updates again.If you get through all these steps and are still hung up that means we gotta get in there and fix it remotely.

Jim_N,"             2018-08-30 01:58:16 UTC           ","Immediate thoughts are weight and buoyancy. Positioning on the ROV is another consideration. It‰Ûªs ok to drop the CG from ROV center, but you want to ensure you don‰Ûªt drop the CB or you‰Ûªll flip the ROV over as soon as you drop it in the water. There‰Ûªs a righting moment that you will create when you start moving CG and CB around.Software wise, sounds totally doable. I played a little with the NODEMCU using Lua.However, electromagnets could cause adverse interference with the on-board electronics. I don‰Ûªt know for sure but it‰Ûªs something you‰Ûªll want to test. I used electro magnets for payloads on quad rotors a few years ago and though cool, played havoc with the INS. We had to add metal shielding‰Û_awful idea, lol. Didn‰Ûªt want to spend money on a Mil spec shielded INS at the time.I Can‰Ûªt give you assurance, but it would be a good experiment for the community. I‰Ûªve seen people drop a lot more on physical science impossibilities, so 100 bucks for an education is pretty good.Breaking it down:Check electro magnet interference. So look at the static field characteristics of the actuator. I suspect that it won‰Ûªt be too bad, may not even be a problem at all if you keep far off the surface of the ROV.Check your ideal placement. Ensure you drop CG below CB and keep it aligned with the ROVs CM, or you‰Ûªl have to add weights, etc to keep it from tilting and being un-flyable.Check weight of hook and consider if your in fresh or salt water. you‰Ûªll need to address this.There‰Ûªs no current API available for payload interfacing. OpenROV is working towards getting this out, from what has been written in other posts. I do not know when this will happen. But hook to the RTI DDS impl exist. I‰Ûªll be looking into this over the next week. https://gitlab.com/openrov/trident/openrov-dds/tree/masterOne thing I haven‰Ûªt had a chance to do yet is analyze the wifi and start digging into what‰Ûªs there. One thing that has been absent is Trident API and hierarchy documentation. But, I have full faith it will be out soon.Interested to hear how it goes!Jim"
Jim_N,"             2018-08-30 02:34:30 UTC           ","Ok, so you got me invested in this.Do you really need a 25Kg lifting force magnet? One thing that just hit me is that aside from the weight you are going to add to the ROV from the magnet, power board, power supply, and the communications widget, you have payload housing to consider, and THEN you need to consider how much added mass to lift and bring to the surface.You selected a 25kg magnet. Not only is that big, it‰Ûªs going to have a significant static field when engaged, so you need to characterize this.How much is all this going to weigh? and How are you going to hand the buoyancy? The last thin you want o do is add weight to the ROV and not increase the buoyant force. Now you‰Ûªre talking foam. And even more foam with you really want to bring 2.5Kg up from the dark depths of the underworld. (what it can lift is the lifting force divided by 10)I think we can make some good engineering design decisions by first looking at the requirements of what you would like to do, then how much it‰Ûªs going to weigh and size, power (SWAPC - Size Wieght Power cost analysis). It‰Ûªs not hard, but trust me, do this first before you drop money.Let‰Ûªs think about it."

I was thinking of attaching a secondary tether to the hook, so when it was detached, I would move the ROV away, and retrieve the object by hand.  I was going to position the payload and hook off the front of the ROV, but now that you mention Center of Gravity, I am having second thoughts about it.  Perhaps I can add a clear enclosure like this:  https://www.polycase.com/ml-44f-1508 and put in a secondary camera at lower res pointing down, to help with positioning.  Would the air contained in the enclosure help with the buoyancy issue.  I guess I need to break out the University Engineering Textbooks :).  I was thinking the 25kg, since  the adafruit link mentions a pickup force of 5-10 times less.  I was hoping to dual purpose the EM to attract any small metal items on the floor by positioning the trident over them and activating the EM.I am working in super low visibility, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs59Uczw2dk&t=100s.  and 3M of depth.

Jim_N,"             2018-09-02 13:58:22 UTC           ","HI Zack, some thoughts:Do you mean power or recording? I wouldn‰Ûªt think power unless we are extending dives beyond GoPro charge lifetime. I see this as a future possibility during survey work, as an example. Recording, yes. It‰Ûªs annoying parsing 2+ hours of video from 30 minutes of actual needed data. However, supplying an API, which may already exist, with topside UI control to at least the major functions, would be perfect.Absolutely care. If you spend all your efforts and battery just trying to stay at a constant depth, your ROI on the dive will be very low and result in payload abandonment for other solutions. I strapped a Go-Pro forward of CG and didn‰Ûªt compensate, Trident just kept nose diving. (I didn‰Ûªt do the math before hand)That being said, any payload solution needs to, if not provide compensation, list out needed adjustments for compensation as part of the deliverable.More on this point, Most users don‰Ûªt understand righting moments and won‰Ûªt think of how drastically the Trident flight characteristics change when you add stuff to the kit. what maybe a better solution is, though one can attach payloads using the bolt patterns on the bottom of the kit, to have a tool sled like attachment that can better assist in CG/CB effects of various payloads. This removes dependencies on small payload kits and opens the foot print for buoyancy compensation without driving payload cost up due to added foam, etc to the kits individually. Also, if you plan on having more than 1 kit, you increase the into kit dependencies that may be problematic. Not sure.AllMax 50m here in the Chesapeake. Majority ~ 10m some 30 in dredge channels under some of the bridges. , some Oyster reefs, wrecks, piers, boat hulls, rip-rap, crab pots and SAV, submerged aquatic vegetation.Yes.

carterhbond,"             2016-05-14 23:11:35 UTC           ","Hi.To my understanding there is an ongoing issue with camera in high contrast situations pausing. This same freezing has seen with complicated grid patterns (like the tiling on the sides of pools). When the servo moves the camera up or down the image can sometimes become too complicated for it to process and it has issues.Maybe try running some tests with different backgrounds and see if it still freezes.  If it does still freeze, it could be a issue with the wire connecting to the Beaglebone.The white wire that connects the camera to the Beaglebone has had issues that cause the signal to drop out. If the camera continues to freeze in the above situation you can run a test on the wire. If you remove the camera from the rest of the ROV and then plug it into your laptop you should be able to view the image with a standard webcam viewer. If you play around with the wire see if the video cuts out. If it does cut out then it is more than likely this connecting wire.If the camera works without issues on a computer, than maybe your connection between the camera and the cable was loose and was simply needing to be connected better.Hopefully some of this info will help out. Good luck with things!"

I‰Ûªm able to re-produce easily in a dark room while my ROV boots up, when I‰Ûªm not connected it starts flashing the leds.  In this low-light situation the flashing causes the camera to kernel panic.  When I‰Ûªm on the water in the daytime the camera works much better however it usually kernel panics the same way when I attempt to adjust the camera tilt. In every case, rebooting is the only way I‰Ûªve found to reset the camera.  I‰Ûªm still trying to figure out if there is a camera configuration setting that might lessen the frequency of these kernel panics.  This seemed to happen less frequently but in a similar way on the previous version of 2.8 which had the wheezy kernel.  (As opposed to this new jessie kernel).Edit: It does seem that with *just the kernel panic sometimes it‰Ûªs possible to stop and start the cockpit software from the management page and the camera comes back.  However, once it starts saying ‰ÛÏcannot seq freq‰Ûù then I have to reboot.   Here‰Ûªs my log from dmesg https://gist.github.com/jeremyd/2a0eb7a089524c0d4ac0f1047f98c79d"

This problem is one of the major issues that has been resolved in the new version of the app that we are about to publish. We are doing the final testing for this release now, which is going well.In the mean time, I would like to offer a potential workaround for those of you experiencing the issue:The underlying cause of this issue is that the app is not properly displaying the feedback that the vehicle is sending it about the firmware upgrade. When you see the ‰ÛÏChecking the ROV‰Ûªs Internet Connection‰Ûù screen, it is very likely that the vehicle actually IS performing the upgrade underneath the hood, it‰Ûªs just that the app isn‰Ûªt properly showing that. One thing that you can try to do is this:Hit ok to start the firmware upgradeWhen it gets to the ‰ÛÏChecking the ROV‰Ûªs Internet Connection‰Ûù page, just let it sit there for 5 minutesAfter 5 minutes, hit the back button on the phone/tablet to go back to the dashboardForce close the app and re-open itAt this point, the firmware upgrade may have successfully gone through and the indicator might be gone.It‰Ûªs kind of a guessing game, since there is no feedback, so you may have to try a couple of times.If this doesn‰Ûªt work for you, please just hang tight, the new release will be available soon!"

Eric_Stackpole,"             2018-04-13 08:52:17 UTC           ","Hey all! If the device you‰Ûªre using has a built in compass (tablets as well as the Trident controller don‰Ûªt but phones often do) then an additional arrow will show up that indicates the direction that device is pointing for reference. For devices without an internal compass, the reference arrow won‰Ûªt appear. The larger vehicle arrow for Trident is linked to a magnetometer on-board the vehicle that detects magnetic north and also fuses that data with a rate gyro. In order for this system to work well, the vehicle usually needs to be calibrated. To do this, I recommend (before starting your dive) rotating the vehicle back and forth about each of its three axis several times. This will allow the magnetometer to detect where north is and ignore other magnificent fields. We‰Ûªre still catching up on documentation, but we hope to have a tutorial for all this stuff sometime soon. Thank you everyone for helping each-other get this stuff figured out in the meantime!"

filippo.f3rrario,"             2018-07-18 01:10:10 UTC           ","Thanks for the info.I recently had the chance to test the TRIDENT at sea for the first time in a proper way. Reading this tread of posts I understood that the Trident need to be calibrated before a dive. I did spin the rov around the 3 axes and the heading I read on the singularity pad seems to agree with analogical compass directions. However I noticed that as soon as I put the rov in the water and I start diving the heading readings become unreliable.After some trials I had the impression that when the trident change inclination, mainly up and down, the heading is altered even if i did not change the direction compared to the north. This basically happen almost all the time since I frequently need to adjust the pitch (up and down) even when moving left and right.Today I tested it again and what I noticed is that, even if calibrated, at some point the reading on the compass go off. However when I retrieved it was still point north correctly.If I do not calibrate it, as someone was proposing here, the heading go off pretty soon.The consequence is that I can‰Ûªt really figure out where I‰Ûªm going and I end up doing random dives.Is this a problem just of my unit or It‰Ûªs me doing something wrong?Any fix?Thank you very much."
TCIII,"             2018-07-18 12:55:26 UTC           ","@filippo.f3rrario,I suspect that the magnetic fields generated by the Trident‰Ûªs thruster motors are influencing the compass on the Trident especially the magnetic field of the vertical thruster. I have seen the same thing happen with the compass in the IMU module on my OROV2.8.This peculiarity has been discussed to some extent about the IMU module that is available for the OROV2.x. The understanding was that when the thrusters are operational the IMU module will use the gyro/accels for heading and then revert back to the compass when the thrusters are off and no magnetic fields are being generated by the thruster motors.Regards,TCIII AVD"

I especially want them to tell me if there is anything I can do differently to improve the habitat. The dredging action fluffs up the sea floor and allows deeper penetration by the sea life.

It‰Ûªd be really good to get a few hours flight time here with the longer tether if I can get it working at all.

My recording of the dive was about 1 minute long before the video stalled and I experienced total lack of control again. I hadn‰Ûªt even started aiming for any depth, I was just keeping the trident below the surface.It‰Ûªs odd that the video and controls seem to work smooth on the surface the 100m tether, and that my 25m tether works fine both in and out of water, but both ends of my 100m tether seem to have trouble. I‰Ûªm not pulling much tether off the spool, so maybe 90-95 meters of the cable has been untouched on each dive, and now I‰Ûªve had the same issue with both ends. I think there‰Ûªs something I don‰Ûªt get about how this cable works.By the way, I used the 100m tether as I was rinsing the trident in fresh water as well. I dunked the trident in a bucket of fresh water and ran the motors, first front down for the center motor, and then rear down for the other two motors (nice that it just fits into a bucket). The trident was on for at least 5 minutes in wet conditions, connected to the 100m tether, without any issues at all. This was immediately after the dive in salt water."

I counted how many half-turns I rotate the thumb screw to attach the tether, and it seems around 7 half turns is enough to tighten the connector, this goes for both tethers, and also counts for both the topside and the trident itself.I had a closer look at the connector itself, and the connectors appear to be two pieces glued together. Could there be a leak in the actual connector?? If so I‰Ûªm very unfortunate, because there must be a leak in both connectors on the 100m tether. Seems unlikely.

That‰Ûªs not to say that you don‰Ûªt have faulty mouldings. You may want to closely examine the mating faces of the connector, particularly the circular surrounds to the gold coloured contacts. Unlike salt water, fresh water is not a particularly good conductor of electricity; this would possibly explain why your bucket test did not reveal a fault - you could try filling your bucket with sea water and repeat the test. The salt water may be allowing a track between contact points if the seating is compromised.Other possibilities include a structural defect within the tether or other interference such as an induction problem; you may like to consider unwinding more, if not all, of the tether and try another salt water dive. Your posts suggest that the problem may have escalated from appearing at 10-15 metres depth to just below the surface, in which case it may be time to accept that the tether has to be returned for repair/replacement.

I would not recommend going direct DC for charging, Lithium batteries can be fickle and not using the supplied charger is a recipe for disaster.Using a 100 Watt solar panel charging a battery (your inverter attached to the battery) assuming optimal solar conditions it should be more than enough to charge the 95 Wh capacity battery (refer to the specs)."

The Full Panel Viewer will display 1280X720 while the Binocular Viewer splits the 720 in half for each eye piece.I purchased the Transformer Full Panel Viewer discount package from getfpv.com. I recommend these Li-ion 18650B batteries to power the Display Viewer and this HDMI cable to connect the output of a laptop to the mini input of the Display Viewer.Since my up close eyesight is pretty bad I could not focus the full panel with the included lens. My solution was to purchase a set of magnifier lenses and an extension for the Full Panel Viewer display.The combination of the highest power magnifying lens (3.5 power) and the display extension has allowed me to focus the Full Panel display without any trouble. After removal of the ‰ÛÏU‰Ûù shaped mounting clip on the top of the magnifier lens it fit right in place where the original Transformer magnifier lens is mounted without any modifications. Depending on how bad your close up eyesight is, you may be able to get away with using the included magnifier lens and just the extension.Hope that this helps those who are looking for an inexpensive headset with HD resolution.Regards,TCIII AVD"

You don‰Ûªt need this particular headset, I think most any would do, Google Cardboard and the like.Your android should already be able to split screen, however, you need two instances of the OpenROV cockpit app running to have simultaneous video for the left and right side lenses in the VR Headset.The hacky way to do this is to install AppCloner from the Google Play Store, and start an instance of OpenROV in the cloner and another standard. Hit the intents button on your phone, this is the multi window looking one on my galaxy. the upper right, select lock apps and you‰Ûªll notice the split screen button appear on the individual app windows. hit that, and select the app for the split screen you want.Fire up the trident and connect to the kit with each app.You did it.

However, that‰Ûªs winter time here in Norway, so the conditions can be freezing. Can I hack a hole in the ice and dive with the Trident in these conditions? I think my main concern would be when I lift the ROV up out of the cold (but warmer than freezing) water into freezing air. Water in any small cracks or crevices will freeze and expand, with enough force to crack rocks.So my question is, should I keep the dives to ‰ÛÏwarmer‰Ûù days, eg warmer than freezing? Or can I venture out into the freezing cold without worries?"
Eric_Stackpole,"             2016-08-24 19:14:49 UTC           ","Hi ketil1!Trident is certainly being designed for under-ice diving. In fact, the concept for Trident initially came together durring an expedition in Antarctica where we were deploying a (much more expensive) ROV under the sea ice in the Ross Sea. Tridents dimension should allow it to fit down a standard 10"" (250mm) Jiffy Ice Drill hole.All that being said, I should be careful to mention that we haven‰Ûªt yet done empirical testing of Trident in extreme cold conditions. We‰Ûªll learn a lot more about how freezing conditions (and other environments) affect the vehicle after we‰Ûªve done more field testing, and we‰Ûªll try to publish best practices guidelines once we have that info.Great question- it will be fun to see Trident being used in such interesting places!"

I look forward to getting more info on this, but I‰Ûªll probably try to keep my dives to days that aren‰Ûªt super cold before we know more.Winter water is much clearer (in many places, anyway), so from that perspective the cold should make for superior exploration conditions! For example, a small bay I often visit during summers is mostly 70-100m deep, and has a 40m deep plateau somewhere out there. Locals tell me that they can see the 40m deep plateau from boats in the winter. In the summer, it‰Ûªs all just darkness when looking from the surface. "
Aidan_Karley,"             2016-08-29 03:40:21 UTC           ","Is it possible to have a waterproof box on site when you retrieve te ROV. ROV into box ; pour buckets of water from ice-hole into box, with some salt (or other freezing supressant) until ROV covered in water ; lid onto box ; pack up and leave site. At base / workshop you can unpack the kit in (relative) warmth.By the time you‰Ûªve got the lid on the box, it will take much longer for the whole box to freeze. Even just keeping the wind off it will improve matters a lot.Plan B - if you haven‰Ûªt got time / weight for plan A might be to have a large waterproof bag to put the ROV into, then add an anti-freeze to the bag which isn‰Ûªt an environmental poison (alcohol from camping stove, for e.g.). Pack up and get to somewhere (relatively) warm. But you‰Ûªd have to check the compatibility of the anti-freeze with o-rings, lube, etc.I was talking to a man from Poseidon (diving regulator manufacturer) who recommended ‰ÛÏwinterising‰Ûù their demand valves by filling with Malt Scots Whiskey - doesn‰Ûªt freeze (well, to ~ -60C) and doesn‰Ûªt damage their o-rings or lube.

Here‰Ûªs a little bit of info that might help get folks on the right path:if it‰Ûªs still pulling left or right, check that both motors turn relatively freely by hand. They can be a little different from each-other but major differences could indicate a physical problem.In the settings or diagnostics pane there is a motor slider, you can enter a value and see if that in both the port and starboard motors and check how it flies from there.If these are not working it could be the motor or the esc (hard to tell).

Previous experience with my OpenROV 2.8 highlighted the difficulty of trying to operate in strong daylight conditions (hence the goggles), while any presence of rain almost always halted proceedings. With this in mind I have sourced a windowed waterproof glove protector for the controller (I think would also be suitable for use with the JXD).

Unfortunately, you can‰Ûªt receive GPS signals underwater, so GPS location could only be determined at the surface aboard the buoy that Trident tows. This would give you a (large) ballpark location of the ROV, but not nearly enough accuracy for autonomous navigation. If the ROV‰Ûªs direction and distance from the buoy could be determined with sensors, then the ROV‰Ûªs coordinates could be calculated, but I don‰Ûªt know how/if that could be done; maybe someone else has a good idea."

The areas we get our students to work in for teaching exercises are usually shallow, near shore and from 2 - 8m deep.First thing i‰Ûªll try is shortening off the tether length (bundling it up, NOT cutting it short) and trying to do a survey pattern with the Trident 1-1.5m below the surface (if its depth keeping is good enough).I‰Ûªm hoping that with a downward facing GoPro / lasers as an external payload, that will mean that the GPS in the WiFi buoy will give me a useful (in my context) level of position accuracy out of the box.  If it works, then i would get a short, 2m or so, tether made up and try that.I have thought about a pole / frame, with a GPS antenna rigged as an external payload above and behind the Trident?  Fly the Trident at a constant depth so that the antenna is just out of the water and a constant distance and orientation relative to the Trident?  Will try the short tether first though as is simpler and should have less drag / weight distribution issues to deal with‰Û_i think?Deeper water and most research applications would mean acoustic positioning gear though.Much to play with and try out with this beast. "

onerealtyfl,"             2017-03-05 20:16:14 UTC           ","I am very excited for the Trident ROV that you are about to release, and I am going to be ordering one this week  I do, however, want to ask a few questions that this community may be able to help me with.  My dive buddies and I wish to use the ROV to assist us in exploring areas offshore the South Florida area.  We are avid technical divers trained by the Global Underwater Explorers and believe it or not, very little true exploration is currently done in the areas that we frequent.  Most divers, technical divers included, dive the same thing time after time and do not engage in real exploration in the ocean.  We are bored with the same old dive sites and wish to shift our efforts into actual exploration.  We have a boat with 3d sonar that we will use to scout for interesting bottom features, once we identify spots of interest we wish to deploy your ROV to see it before we dive it to see if it‰Ûªs worth diving.  This will allow us to cover way more ground than simply diving it outright.  As an example, if we dive a 200 foot dive our bottom time would be limited to about 20 minutes, with upwards of 60 minutes of decompression to follow.  Not only is this time consuming, but it also costs close to $200 per diver to do this type of exploration in the 200 foot range.  Needless to say, we are excited for the ROV   My questions are as follows:Do you have a tether that is neutrally buoyant in salt water or if not, how does the ROV with the tether handle in salt water?What is the best controller to use to control the ROV and what software would you run to do so?  I assume a laptop is best to interface it with, but what are your suggestions?  I have an iPad as well as a MacBook Pro and we are looking for the most precise control possible of the ROV.Have you had a chance to test this in a high current area?  I see videos where the ROV does great in near static current conditions, but we will be deploying it in areas that sometime have rather swift currents.Looking forward to your responses and to receiving the ROV of course Thanks!Matt Cain"

Brian_Grau,"             2017-03-06 19:53:51 UTC           ","This is a use case that we are excited to see people use the vehicle for, exploring new places that have never before been seen by humans!In answer to your questions.The tether for the vehicle is neutrally buoyant in fresh water, so it will be slightly buoyant in salt water. This will have minimal effect on vehicle performance. If you look at the second half of this video it shows the third person view of the vehicle in the water and you can see how the tether handles. This was filmed in Hawaii in salt water.The control device is kind of up to the users personal preference. As @Brendan mentioned a screen that works will in daylight is definitely a plus. Tablets normally have brighter screens than laptops, but we use both here at the lab. As we get more of these in the field and run user testing we will be able to give some better recommendations.We have tested in a few high current situations. Since the vehicle is very hydrodynamic it handles going into the current well. Shooting video where you can see the performance is a little more challenging. The San Francisco area of the Pacific Ocean is where we test, but visibility is not great so shooting third person is hard. As a diver myself my opinion is that it would be able to handle any current that I as a diver would be comfortable getting into.The video recording is onto whatever the control device is (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.). We are looking at tapping into the GPS information on phones and tablets to embed this GPS information into the video. More on this to come closer to the release date.Let us know if you have additional questions, and I can‰Ûªt wait to see what you explore with the vehicle!"

If you put a GPS on the float itself that would at least get you in the ballpark of where you need to be to find the same location again in the future. Is it perfect, no, but it‰Ûªs better than nothing, especially if it recorded the video with the gps coordinates of the float always available, along with the depth info of course.  I have spoken to other engineers about more accurate ways to determine GPS coordinates of the ROV itself.  The best answer I‰Ûªve head so far is you would have to develop a tether that is retractable and as it is let out, it keeps a slight tension on the line to keep it almost straight, it would also have to be able to measure how much line is out and somehow figure out the angle, with all that info you should be able to get the coordinates of the ROV on the bottom.  Easier said than done, but hey just throwing that out there!"

Our sensors are managed by an on-board Arduino that can display sensor readings on it‰Ûªs serial monitor. We would like to send data from the Arduino to the OpenROV Beaglebone so we can see it on our computer above ground. I believe the OpenROV has external cables for I2C communication, but are there any for UART Serial communication? I have the system working flawlessly through Serial comms, so it‰Ûªd be great not to have to change up my code for a new communication protocol.I imagine there would have to be hardware modifications? I had issues finding documentation covering this, so any insight is very helpful.Thank you!!"

Walt_Holm,"             2017-10-04 18:00:01 UTC           ","Hi @jlewallen18:You can definitely hook up a payload with a UART interface to your OpenROV, but its going to take a little bit of work on your part.The first thing you should do is grab a schematic for the controller board of your OpenROV.  You can find them on our Github site here.There are six auxiliary wires that come out of the OpenROV housing that can be used for whatever you want.  Note that on the OpenROV 2.8, five of those wires are pre-wired for lights and an external servo, so to use them for a UART you will have to break the existing connection to free up those wires.  Assuming you have a model 2.8, I would re-purpose the external servo wires (TP23-TP25) into a UART connection.  If you look at Sheet 2 of the schematic, I would remove R70 and R71, freeing up auxiliary wires TP23 and TP24 for the transmit and receive lines.  TP25 can be left as a ground signal.Then on your controller board you‰Ûªre going to have to run wires from the test pads TP23 and TP24 over to a free UART port on the microcontroller.   The microcontroller on the controller board is a ATMega 2560, the same as is used on the Arduino Mega.  If you study the free microcontroller I/O that is brought to the header sockets (Sheet 2 again), and cross them against the I/O of an Arduino Mega, you will see that there are a number of UARTs free for the end-user.  Note that the AtMega serial ports run at a 5V level.  If your device is 3.3V or true RS-232 (12V I think‰Û_) then you will have level-shift the signals appropriately.This leaves writing the software to get your telemetry topside.  If you‰Ûªre using software 30.0.3, Charles Cross wrote this post on how to develop software for your unit.Hope this helps.  Let us know how things progress.-W"

Biggs_Darklighter,"             2017-10-19 04:47:05 UTC           ","Hello, I recently contacted OpenROV support and after a few emails back and forth, Nicole recommended that I post this up out here to get others involved in the conversation.  As I have studied further some of the questions I originally had have been answered fully, or partially.  I am reaching that knowledge ‰ÛÏtipping point‰Ûù where I am starting to get a pretty solid big picture.None of the existing ROV packages out there fit my needs, or they cost as much as my house (so again, not fitting my needs lol).  The Trident comes very close, but not available yet, and still not ‰ÛÏperfect.‰ÛùI want to go with the OpenROV platform though for the most important thing appears to be covered.  I need the ability to build my own basestation, or use just about any available platform.  So I am thinking to put together my own kit using the 2.8 developers kit.  When I priced everything out individually, you basically get a free tether!  I will likely go with a neutrally buoyant tether, but the dev kit one will at least get me online.I have a handful of questions though!I need a wireless buoy.  (At least I think I do!)  I will be using an HD camera setup, either the Pro Upgrade and chassis, or the Blue Robotics camera.  I won‰Ûªt go into more details on the BR stuff, but have seen that I am not alone in a hybrid build.  Simply put for my needs, their enclosures are more configurable.  Otherwise, I am preferring the simpler nature of the OpenROV stuff, and the MUCH better documentation.  Anyways, the first question:Can a 2.4g wireless connection even reliably support the higher HD video data stream?  Obviously we are out of the water at this point.Is there a Tenda wireless adapter that can be used on the topside?I read the wireless buoy tutorial, but it seems that there has to be a cleaner way to build it‰Û_  I can‰Ûªt fully wrap my head around this.  Now if I could power the topside buoy through the tether from the ROV main battery, using a setup otherwise like the tutorial would make a little more sense.I need a different main chassis configuration.  I tempt fate here as I am sure it will take me some effort to get my design balanced.  The sides will have a tie fighter like look, like the Shark Marine‰Ûªs Stealth 2 visible here:img_0016.jpg788x591 127 KBMy main concern is that ideally I (think I) want 2 vertical thrusters and the 2 horizontal thrusters. It appears the controller board has outputs for 6 various servo or esc based devices.  I am just unsure how one goes about applying those.  Is the interface similar to say Open Pilot (well actually now Libre Pilot), or Betaflight for air based UAV‰Ûªs?How does the controller function, would a fourth ESC be added in parallel to the vertical thruster esc?Can I order additional ESCs from you guys?  Or better yet, can I order the controller board without esc‰Ûªs and use my own?Would the software image need to be changed to function with a 4th thruster?  Or again, is this handled via a interface like Open Pilot‰Û_.  ???  Also how does it handle more thrusters, say 6 like some other platforms use?  Documentation claims control up to six thrusters, but a glance at the pictures only showed obvious spots for the 3‰Û_Can I order the scaling laser diodes separately?  Or get a digikey part number?  I may not be using the OpenROV camera module as I really want the ability to upgrade the camera, and possibly record video onboard.Final question, for now!Can I use ‰ÛÏany‰Ûù USB joystick or gamepad controller?  If so, how and where do I program the functions?I have a Saitek Cyborg 3 that i purchased as soon as I saw it the other day, just for this project!  Hopefully it can be utilized‰Û_My apologies as I am SURE lots of these questions are covered in various places in the different guides.  I have seen a few of my questions kinda touched on as I research them (and in fact did find and answer a few I deleted).I will try to wait patiently for answers lol!  I am waiting on some of these to decide on final parts to order.  It would be cheaper to buy a full kit, but I want the flexibility of a slightly different configuration, as mentioned first thing above.I do have an extensive background in arial drones and electronics.  But this is new territory and as such the information out there (in general) is pretty scarce.  Thank you guys in advance for your help!"
Walt_Holm,"             2017-10-20 23:24:11 UTC           ","Hi @Biggs_Darklighter:Here are some answers to your questions:1.) You can use WiFi, but typical WiFi implementations are not optimized for sending low-latency, interruption-free video.  The results you get will depend upon the amount of intereference in your area.  In general, prepare to be very disappointed with the performance of WiFi when used as communication to a buoy.For OpenROV Trident we‰Ûªve spent a huge amount of time tweaking the code in the video pathway to achieve good, low-latency performance.2.) A couple of years ago we expermented with a Tenda WiFi homeplug unit for a topside.  We ended up not releasing a product at the time, as we were busy with other stuff.  But it would certainly be easy to experiment with at home.  The Tenda model number was PW201 and it is still in production, and seems to be available on E-bay, though it doesn‰Ûªt seem to be available on Amazon or major retailers.3.) It is pretty easy to add a fourth ESC to the current controller board.  If you search the forum archives you‰Ûªll find a post that I did a couple years ago outlining the procedure.  If you are driving the two vertical ESCs with the same signal, you can do that without modifying code by just buying a ‰ÛÏY-cable‰Ûù for the two vertical servos.4.) I don‰Ûªt believe we sell individual ESCs in the store, but the ESCs used on the controller board are available from HobbyKing. You‰Ûªll need to reprogram it from forwards-only (helicopter mode) to forward-reverse (car mode).  This has been discussed before on the forum.I don‰Ûªt think we sell controller boards without the ESCs.  There are just too few customers for such a product.5.) If you‰Ûªre not trying to do vertrans control (if you‰Ûªre running both vertical ESCs at the same speed), then you don‰Ûªt need any software changes for the 4th thruster- just use a Y-cable instead.  There was an experimental build a while ago for a 4-thruster vertrans configuration, but it hasn‰Ûªt been maintained in a while.6.) According to the OROV 2.8 bill-of-materials, here are the scaling lasers we use.  I don‰Ûªt know whether they‰Ûªre in the store.  Have you looked?7.) Don‰Ûªt know.Hope this helps.  Keep us posted on how your build goes.-W"

I have thought of doing similar myself, but since photography is my first intent here, I decided to go with some more purpose made components to protect my gear.  If I put one of my proper cameras in this rig, that camera will easily eclipse the cost of the actual ROV build, by double or more.I was also a little leery of trusting the OpenROV DIY housing to pressure, waterproofness, and building mistakes.  Plus one drawback to the OpenROV style setup, shooting through a curved tube causes light refraction issues.  These are solved in the HD Camera setup with a special lense.  But I can‰Ûªt apply that lens to a M4/3rds format camera.  I go with this setup and I am limited to just using the OpenROV camera, no chance for upgrades.A domed end though solves this problem.  Blue Robotics sells (for a substantial price increase) tube, dome, and other components needed to make bodies like this.  The way they are made, already adds several layers of protection to the ‰ÛÏonion‰Ûù and are similar techniques and construction used for camera dive cases.  And suddenly I can put any camera that I want (and can fit) into the tube.  An inexpensive option like a GoPro Hero Session becomes possible.Originally I planned to use the Pro-Upgrade.

They are fast (200 Mbit/sec for HomePlug AV and 500 Mbit/sec for IEEE1901), don't require an arbitrary cable impedance, and allow power to be sent over the tether simultaneously.  Most importantly, they are inexpensive due to mass production- a pair of HomePlug adapters can be purchased fo‰Û_  The BBB in the ROV runs a webserver and the browser on your computer communicates with the server using socket.io.

It‰Ûªs really interesting.Here is my understanding:For the original home plug unit:The power supply board collects 110 AC and step it down and rectify it into a 3.3V DC to supply power to the high-tech board. the J7 and J2 pins are the interface for RF communication.The 110 AC acts as a carrier wave which carries the RF signal generated by the high-tech board. I suppose the RF signal has a very different (higher) frequency than the 50Hz 110 AC.For the modified home plug with top side adapter in our ROV:The power of the high tech board comes from the top side adapter‰Ûªs mini USB port. roughly 5V DC.The 4.5V DC between the tether pins acts as a carrier wave (please verify my statement) carries the RF generated by the high-tech board to the ROV. The 4.5 V DC is also used to turn on the ROV.speaking of modulation, is this some kind of frequency modulation (FM)? but usually, in FM, there is a low frequency carrier wave and a signal wave (usually with much higher frequency) to be modulated. In this case, does the 4.5V DC really behave like a carrier?Please clarify my understanding!Many thanks!"

It will work perfectly fine over a pair of wires that has no DC voltage on it.We take advantage of this to use DC voltage to signal whether the ROV should be turned on or not.  If there is more than ~3V DC on the tether, the ROV turns on.  Remove the DC voltage from the tether, and the ROV turns off.-W"

It‰Ûªs an eye opener for me!Just to quote from wiki:‰ÛÏOFDM is a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme used as a digital multi-carrier modulation method. A large number of closely spaced orthogonal sub-carrier signals are used to carry data on several parallel data streams or channels. Each sub-carrier is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme (such as quadrature amplitude modulation or phase-shift keying) at a low symbol rate, maintaining total data rates similar to conventional single-carrier modulation schemes in the same bandwidth.‰Ûù‰ÛÏIn OFDM, the subcarrier frequencies are chosen so that the subcarriers are orthogonal to each other, meaning that crosstalk between the subchannels is eliminated and intercarrier guard bands are not required. This greatly simplifies the design of both the transmitter and the receiver. In conventional FDM, a separate filter for each subchannel is required.‰Ûùnow my only doubt is that for the original homeplug unit, the mains voltage is merely used to provide power to the homeplug board through a step down transformer and a AC to DC converter, it is not used as a carrier neither since the homeplug is able to generate sub-carriers.ThanksSJX"

We did modify one once with a second remote camera, but it requires some building skills to make it all work out.  So it may not be an option for you.  After you build your 2.8 and get it working, you can be the judge whether you want to try to add another camera.I think @Marius_Antares did most of the work for the modification- if he‰Ûªs still reading the forum, he might have some pictures of it.  Basically, a second Beaglebone Black was placed inside the chassis, as well as a small ethernet switch/router.  Each Beaglebone was running OpenROV software, but they were set to different static IP addresses.  The second camera was put in a waterproof housing, and the cable was run through a hole drilled in an endcap, and potted in place.  The two Beaglebones and the Homeplug adapter were each connected to the router.On the topside, a separate browser tab is used to view each camera stream.It might be possible to combine two cameras at the USB level, with a USB hub.  There was an old thread talking about this here.  However, there are issues with the libraries that are used to support the Pro Camera, so unless you want to do a lot of software tinkering, I don‰Ûªt think its possible to have two of those cameras running on a single Beaglebone at this time.Hope this helps.-Walt"

It represents the latest in everything we've learned about building an affordable and capable underwater robot. Although the overall shape may seem similar to the previous version, almost every aspect of the ROV has been improved and upgraded. Our focus has been on increasing the usability and robustness of the vehicle, while keeping the price as accessible as possible. We're proud of what we've come up with.From a performance perspective, the OpenROV v2.7 is the best ROV we've ever built. It streams HD video back to the surface laptop over an ultra-thin two-wire tether. It maneuvers using the same thruster configuration as previous models, however new hydrodynamic adjustments, new motors, and new motor speed controllers have resulted in greatly improved handling and control, especially in the vertical direction. A new LED board provides even more illumination in the depths, and the lasers provide both scaling and distance measurement capability.You can learn more about the robot here: http://store.openrov.com/collections/frontpage/products/openrov-v2-7-kitThe hallmark of OpenROV has always been the community. In addition to the design forums, which provide build advice and add-on ideas, we have also seen a huge amount of activity on OpenExplorer, a platform for OpenROVers (and beyond OpenROV, really) to share their adventures and expeditions. In just the first few months, we've seen over a hundred exciting expeditions created on the site.  FEATURES:Live HD video with wide-angle lens and tilt functionLED lighting for low-light environmentsEasy-to-use web browser user interfaceBeaglebone Black AND Arduino MEGA microprocessors for a flexible and powerful developer platform with dozens of input/output channels and plenty of computing power for user-designed features and experimentsRechargeable lithium batteries (sold separately)100-meter lightweight 2-wire tetherCompact and lightweight--backpack or carry-on readyPayload area for additional hardware or equipmentJoin our open source, ocean-loving community--find all the software and hardware files online as well as a vibrant and enthusiastic community to share adventures, ask questions, and meet other people with passion for exploration Physical specifications:Weight 2.6kgDimensions 30cm long x 20cm wide x 15cm highNominal battery life 2-3 hours (depending on use) Performance specifications:Maximum depth 75m (we‰Ûªve taken them past 100m, but true depth depends on build quality)Maximum tether length 300m (100m tether provided)Maximum forward speed 2 knotsLED brightness 180lm"

By the time I had started my 2 camara‰Ûªs my aidman called me to ask at what depth I had set the ROV. I saw it go to a depth of about 2m without reaction of depth control.I then disengaged the depth control and hit shift to manually move it upwards but the robot didn‰Ûªt react. My aidman then jumped into the water and recovered the ROV.Time submerged: about 3 minutes. Time from losing the controls: about 1 minute or less.I emptied the tube, unplugged the twisted pair cable (no reaction from the ROV electronics), removed the batteries and wiped the electronics with a towel.I then disassembled the electronics and let it dry on a towel in a warm room (close to a water heated radiator and in the sun). In the mean time found out the water was coming in through the hole in the endcap (where you insert the little rubberised plastic plug). This was the first time the robot was tested in a pool. I‰Ûªm strict on following the pre-dive procedure (military background) so I‰Ûªm really disappointed at how things turned out. Maybe the person who made the robot did a bad install because previously I also had problems with the battery tubes. A skilled person got us thicker tubes (the original ones were not perfectly round) and made the endcaps out of one piece. We tried a number of things to get the main container watertight after the incident last week but in the end I filled the hole with epoxy.Now I can let the BBB boot up (normal wavelike pattern from the blue LED‰Ûªs) but I can not connect with the twisted pair cable.tl;dr:Last weekFresh swimming pool water (with Cl, not salt)The tube was filled approx 25% for about 1 minute, pressure went from 0.1 bar to 0.35 bar during the sinking.Water removed from tube, connection on twisted wire cut immediately, batteries removed. The ROV didn‰Ûªt react to a shutdownsignal when I removed the twisted wire.I did not dare to use an aggressive drying procedure so I disassembled the electronic parts, dried them with a fresh towel and lay them on another towel in a warm room close to but not directly above a water heated radiator.I let the electronics sit for about 48 hours. I reassembled everything and connected an usb-cable to the BBB. It just booted up (the blue LED‰Ûªs follow a wavelike pattern).When connecting via the twisted pair cable however the BBB doesn‰Ûªt boot and the Arduino just flashes it‰Ûªs ETH and PWR LED‰Ûªs. I also hear a silent click when the LED‰Ûªs flash on and of (like a relay engaging and disengaging but far more silent).Thank you for your help!"

Yesterday I tested in the poll and it work fine for a couple of minutes. like 3 to 4 minutes, then suddenly everything shut off.  So I disconnected the usb cable in order to prevent any short circuit in the case that the electronics cylinder was making water. It was not.So I re connect the ethernet cable and the usb cable to my Mac Pro. I saw the main board starting to flash the blue leds, a minute or so later the camera LEDS flashed for a couple of times and then the cockpit re-stablished connection with the ROV.So I tried once more, It went into the pool at about 5 ft down it work well, camera, camera LEDS, lasers, all three motors, etc, etc,‰Û_  and 4 minutes later‰Û_ again it suddenly shutdown!!!I repeat the entire process three times, and the same thing kept happening!Today I decided to test the ROV controls, connections and everything I could imagine out of the water. everything worked perfect‰Û_ I even discover a couple of tricks to maneuver and let the motors running with out pushing the forward arrow! any way all was good.Then I noticed that the battery voltage was shifting from 5.6 to 8.3 or 9 volts very fast. I thought it was because I was trying everything, lights intensity, lasers on and of, vertical motor on an of, changing the speed of the motors etc, etc‰Û_So decided to take the batteries out, mark them by side and sequence 1,2,3. and then measure the voltage in each battery.To my surprise, The port side 3 batteries were 50% lower that stboard ones!!!I put the batteries back to both the tubes battery and I just couldnå«t connect to the cockpit. everything started normal, but about two minutes later, the camera LEDS started to blink non stop. untill I disconnected the USB cable.I am now recharging the port side batteries, to try it again.Does this happen to anyone else???  any comments that may help understand what may be happening?Your comments will be much appreciated!Regards!V.

You might find that there is no voltage coming from the starboard battery pack.If this is the case, I would review all the wiring, and make sure that the individual cells in the starboard pack are making solid contact with one another.

A UART has transmit (Tx), receive (Rx), power and GND terminals/pins. This implies that serial communication is a two-way process, and it is. So if you‰Ûªre asking the Arduino to send text in your ArduSlave::Update() function, then what device is receiving that data from the Arduino?If your Beaglebone Black is listening to the Arduino because you have the two devices connected, then how are you monitoring the Arduino device (/dev/ttyUSB0 or /dev/ttyACM0 maybe?) in the BBB? But if your Aduino is connected to your computer directly, then are you opening the serial console inside the Arduino IDE to watch for data coming from it? Are you using a different serial terminal, like PuTTY?In order to help figure out why you‰Ûªre not seeing data from the Arduino, I think we need a lot more information.TB"

Our prototype shells have been made of Urethane resin casts, and CNC milled plastic which allow for very high precision and tight tolerances. With injection molding, this same precision is possible, but it is more difficult to achieve that precision due to the thermal profile of the process.How the thermal profile affects the expansion and contraction of the plastic, and thus the resulting tolerances on the finished shells is something that requires extremely high attention to detail, and it has to be repeatable for thousands, if not tens of thousands of shells.To answer your question, it is reliable. The quality and tolerances of the injection molded shells is something that we are spending a lot of time refining to make sure the many thousands of Trident ROV‰Ûªs we build have the same quality as the high-precision prototypes we had made."

There‰Ûªs no particular reason why the batteries wouldn‰Ûªt work today.  If you have a voltmeter, I‰Ûªd just check the voltage of the individual cells- If they‰Ûªre at full charge they‰Ûªll be around 3.4 volts or so.  Once they‰Ûªve discharged a bit, they‰Ûªll be around 3.2 volts each.The motherboard is designed to work with either LiFePO4 cells (3.2 volts nominal) or Li-NMC  cells (3.7 volts nominal) so that shouldn‰Ûªt be a problem.If the cells seem fine and you‰Ûªre still not getting power, I‰Ûªd make sure that you have prepped the cells correctly- there should be something in the instructions about trimming off the insulation on the bottom of the cell, and perhaps putting a solder blob on the top of the cell.

Regular microphones inside a pressure vessel aren‰Ûªt the best way to do this, as the acoustic transfer from water -> acrylic tube -> air -> microphone really colors the sound quite a bit, especially when its right next to a servo with a low hum.

A lot of hydrophones are tuned to capture >20kHz, as a lot of marine animals communicate in frequency ranges that aren‰Ûªt audible by humans. Whales are below our range, dolphins are much higher. Human range is 20-20k Hz (roughly).So ultimately you would need to select a frequency range, transpose the audio to somewhere between 20-20k Hz (but probably more like 100-15k Hz)."

Armand_Svendsen,"             2014-02-24 19:03:07 UTC           ","I'm having the same problem, have not figured out this yet. The calibration process appears to do nothing. The same goes for depth calibration also. Tried to align compass north and click calibrate, but nothing happened.One thing that did work though (to a certain extend), is to edit MPU9150.cppTo the end of the script the following lines are written:  }    MPU.read();    navdata::HDGD = MPU.m_fusedEulerPose[VEC3_Z] * RAD_TO_DEGREE + 180;  //need to confirm    navdata::PITC = MPU.m_fusedEulerPose[VEC3_X] * RAD_TO_DEGREE;    navdata::ROLL = MPU.m_fusedEulerPose[VEC3_Y] * RAD_TO_DEGREE;    navdata::YAW = MPU.m_fusedEulerPose[VEC3_Z] * RAD_TO_DEGREE;}#endifI changed the HDGD value according to my compass offset. Whilst pointing it towards North, I read a value of -126 degrees. I then changed the ""RAD_TO_DEGREE + 180"" to ""+126""Saved the file, and reloaded the Arduino from cockpit. Afterwards the compass value came up with a heading value of 0 +/-2 degrees. This is in the heading part of the telemetry data shown on rights side of ROVCockpit. The compass dial that is part of the HUD did not show correct unfortunately. This still showed East as heading. Even stranger was when I then rotated the ROV towards East, verified by compass, the ROV heading showed West! Still on telemetry data, the HUD compass is far out.Definitively a puzzle that needs solving!As far as the other vectors like tilt and roll, I would assume applying a similar offset value would work there as well. Have not tried to change this as the values are correct in my set up.The best would of course be if the calibration buttons in the ROV cockpit worked, but still this only handles 2 of the parameters, the rest still needs to be changed elsewhere."

If there is some sort of short circuit in the ESCs or motors, when the ESCs are turned on (via mosfet Q2), the battery voltage will drop, the +5V supply will cut out, the Atmega 2560 will turn off, and Q2 will then turn back off, cutting off the short circuit.  The whole cycle then repeats itself over and over again.When you short across J17, the ESCs are powered on anytime system power is on.What  might have happened is that there was a stray bit of solder causing a short circuit in the one anomalous ESC.  When you jumpered J17 and turned the ROV on, high current from the battery eventually burned out that short circuit.  Once the short circuit had burned itself out, the ROV would then function normally, even with the jumper on J17 removed.Just a guess, but it explains the symptoms.-W"

I‰Ûªve always wondered if things would be improved if that board was staked down inside the brass housing, rather than free-floating.  It‰Ûªs an experiment that I‰Ûªd like to do sometime, but unfortunately there are plenty of things in the queue ahead of this, both for Trident and for my homemade ROVs.We‰Ûªve started talking about a laser scaler option for Trident.

What a difference that makes BTW.I then stumbled across the SETTINGS:VIDEO:Show Video Player statistics and wondered at the results I saw in particular the Dropped Frames stats.The video itself as seen in my screen capture is really quite good but, what should I make of those discarded packets?And, does anyone have any other recommendationsBench Testing HD Video for tuning?"
ROVBrooke,"             2017-03-04 17:08:03 UTC           ","Quick Summary: If you are seeing significant Dropped Frame rates in your cockpit video statistics try disabling the use of Hardware acceleration in Chrome advanced settings.Background:The weekend is here and I‰Ûªve had time to dig in further‰ÛÒIt seems the statistics reported in the cockpit display relate to the on-screen (Chrome browser) display of the ROV‰Ûªs real-time images. Meaning-- number of packets received by Chrome and number dropped by Chrome.I‰Ûªm deducing this (hopefully correctly) by noticing that the statistics on dropped packets are markedly improved when I navigate away from the cockpit (though it is still active in the background but not refreshing the screen at all-- then return to it. Dropped Frame rate does not increment.I checked my Rev of Chrome and I‰Ûªm up to date.I checked my system and have all current (Mac) OS and Drivers (including Graphics accelerator card).I note that I have a responsibly powerful machine-- 2.6GHz Intel Core 5 with 16 Gigs memory and and Intel Iris 1536 Graphics accelerator card, 500Gig Solid State Drive.As part of testing I changed the frame rates and the resolution and found no improvements in the dropped frame rate-- always hovering around 30-50%I next investigated ways to try and force the system to use the Graphics Accelerator Card. There is a Chrome Setting: Advanced Settings: System: Use Hardware Acceleration when available-- but this was already selected.Looking at the CPU monitor I found a process called: VTDecoderXPCService which was consuming most of my CPU cycles in in conjunction with Chrome and Chrome Helper.A google search revealed that the VTDecoderXPCService is a Sandboxing service in OSX. Though there aren‰Ûªt many (any) high level descriptions about it I did find this helpful article:https://medium.com/@cwgem/a-random-encounter-with-videotoolbox-a25a5bc6b24f#.xx3gsrthf.I also found a reference in a help thread re: Chrome Dropped Frames that suggested disabling the ‰ÛÏUse hardware acceleration when available‰Ûù feature-- seems counter intuitive but worth trying. (Requires Chrome reboot)WOW-- what a difference that made. Dropped frames dropped to around 1-5%.I also noticed VTDecoderXPCService left the system monitor or had such a low CPU % that it left the screen.I can only assume the VTDecoderXPCService was invoked by Chrome as part of Hardware Acceleration but I am not certain of that.My CPU cycles significantly increased as a result of the hardware acceleration change-- but I think it‰Ûªll be OK. Not sure how it will impact battery life etc."
charlesdc,"             2017-03-08 19:37:03 UTC           ","Hi @ROVBrooke,First, kudos for digging so deep into what is going on with the video.Dropped frames are frames that the decoder process in chrome throws out for whatever reason. It can be pretty finicky. The recording process is not affected by the dropped frames that you see on the video statistics, and should be reliably recorded without drops for the most part.To explain more about why there are differences when turning hardware accel on and off in Chrome, the current version of the video stream that you are using is missing a set of special parameters in the H264 bitstream which tell the decoder that it should only buffer one frame, that there will be no B-frames, and that no frames will be coming out of order. The software decoder in Chrome doesn‰Ûªt seem to care about those parameters being missing, but the hardware decoder does, as it relies on them for making the best decisions from an optimization viewpoint. In a newer version of the camera server, we have been able to parse the H264 bitstream, modify and rebuild those parameter sets with values that leads to extremely low latency, and as a result, the decoder ends up not waiting for a buffer of 15 frames and choking as we push in new data (resulting in dropped frames in Chrome).These improvements will be rolled out over time as we have the opportunity. For now, using the software decoder on a decent CPU will give you the best results. On mobile, you are forced to use the hardware decoder, so no guarantees there until the new software is ready.Additionally, if recording quality is your goal, I would recommend against using a GOP length of 1. While 1 will allow the decoder to recover more quickly, the image quality will be severely degraded. As the video is coming across at 30fps, using a GOP length of 30 means that it will take up to one second for the decoder to recover from an error, so you can tune the GOP to your needs between 1 and 30, with video quality being improved as you increase it."

This should resolve your issue with downloading the recorded video from the Data page. In the event that this doesn‰Ûªt fix your particular issue, we should be able to recover it, as long as you don‰Ûªt clear your browser‰Ûªs cache in the meantime. The manual cache retrieval method is a bit of a nuisance and differs by OS, so let‰Ûªs wait and see if the new update resolves the issue first. In addition to the retrieval fixes, the other improvements that I mentioned in my previous post will also be making their way in, so you may start seeing better latency and less dropped frames at the decoder.We will post the new release on the forum, but I will also ping you here when we do so.Cheers,Charles"

I would compare the viscosity of the 2 hour marine epoxy to the viscosity of the recommended 2 ton epoxy. For this potting effort you really need an epoxy with as low a viscosity as possible so that it will flow well in the wire channel.Before I potted my Pass-Through Channel I arranged the wire bundle such that the wires were as parallel to each other as possible in the channel so that the epoxy would have minimal resistance as it flowed along the wires to the channel outlet. Make sure to use a full tube of epoxy and to let all the bubbles in the tubes rise to the top of the tubes‰Ûª outlet before starting the mixing process. Also, I would do the potting when the temperature is above 70 degrees F.Regards,TCIII AVD"

Make sure that all the surfaces are coated.Rotate the motors several times to work the lubricant into the upper bearing.Step 38 ‰ÛÓ Motor Protection (cont.)Now apply spray lubricant to the lower bearings in each of the motors.These are accessible through the holes in the acrylic structure as shown on the port and starboard motors.The vertical motor‰Ûªs lower bearing is more difficult to reach and requires you move around the wire bundle.Allow the lubricant to settle and/or dry (about 1 minute for the silicone lubricant).tep 44 ‰ÛÓ Motor MaintenanceThe most important part of post-dive maintenance is cleaning the motors. The exposed magnets tend to corrode easily. The bearings also need to be lubricated and protected from rust.First, rinse the motors with fresh water (see previous step)Then thoroughly dry the motors with compressed air (if available).Immediately afterwards, re-apply spray silicon lubrication. Move the motors with you hands for a few rotations to ensure that the bearings are well lubricated. Review the previous steps on proper lubrication. This should be done before and after each and every dive.WD-40 is great to keep the motors from corroding as it displaces any water. It is not as great as a waterproof lubricant, however and should be used in conjunction with another, more water-resistant lubrication.Regards,TCIII AVD"

What I do is I take the syringe out a few times while the air warms up, and then firmly press down on the end cap while putting the syringe back in. I do it as long as I hear pressure drop when I take it out. I do this as a pre dive procedure. Once the air is well warmed up you can shut down the rov and let the tube cool down until your dive. Be carefull if you want to take the syringe out though cause a negative pressure will have formed and the syringe might be hard to pull out. You don‰Ûªt want the syringe stick to break leaving the rubber part stuck in the end cap."

As long as you are diving it should not be a problem, because the water pressure will just about always be greater than the pressure within the (warm) tube and the water cools the tube.Just be careful when handling the ROV between water and air, and long heat times. Before every dive, briefly take out the syringe, and make a pressure adjustment."

Walt_Holm,"             2017-01-02 07:38:28 UTC           ","Hi:As you may or may not know, the ROV is turned on by placing a 5V signal onto the tether.  This signal turns on the main power switch on the ROV controller board, allowing battery power to flow to the electrical circuitry.  So if your ROV is not powering on, either there‰Ûªs something wrong with the battery connection inside the ROV, or for some reason the voltage is not running down the tether to turn the unit on.The first thing I‰Ûªd check is to see whether the batteries are getting power to the ROV.  If your ROV is fully assembled right now, undo the main tube from the ROV, and pull off the acrylic tube so that you can work with the E-chassis while it‰Ûªs still plugged into the endcap.  On the controller board, find the empty (unstuffed) connector location named J12.  If you‰Ûªre looking at the board with the DB-25 connector on your left, it will be on the lower right side. It‰Ûªs also marked ‰ÛÏPwr switch‰Ûù or something like that.  Anyway, take a short piece of wire and short the two leads of J12 together.  This should turn the ROV on, regardless of whether you have the topside hooked up or not.  If the ROV turns on, then you have an issue with continuity in your tether.  If the ROV does not turn on, then there‰Ûªs probably an issue with battery power not getting to the ROV.  I‰Ûªd download the 2.8 Controller board schematic off of our Github site to help you with any debugging you might need to do.Let us know how your testing efforts go.-Walt"

In a nutshell, size 26650 batteries are made to be tabbed together in battery packs, not slipped into battery tubes.

When I got the ROV to surface, it turned out there was water inside the electronic tube. After some trouble shooting with vacuum pump and water, it turned out that the water came in on the outside of the syringe. I suspect that different material types between the epoxy and syringe, making different expansions at different temperatures can have caused this. My initial plan was to mold a plug with RTV silicone (I have equipment and silicone for molding), making a seal from the outside. But I‰Ûªm also concerned that if this syringe get loose, it could pop into the tube, since there is nothing physically stopping it from moving in, it‰Ûªs just glued to the hole in the endcap. Was thinking of using a piece of plastic and cement it to the backside of the endcap (have some leftovers after HD Pro camera upgrade), with just a small hole for the syringe, making a support and preventing syringe from moving in. Any thoughts about this? Or should I simply order new endcap and syringe? Am I the only one experiencing this? Lekk Syringe.jpg1289x1369 268 KB"

Therefore even if there is unequal expansion between the syringe outer circumference and the epoxy on top of the third disk, the acrylic cement seal between the outer circumference of the syringe and the center holes below the epoxy should have prevented water from traveling along the syringe body into the WTC?I have been able to pull a 540 mm Hg vacuum on the WTC, without the controller board installed, for over two hours without a loss of vacuum.Regards,TCIII AVD"

It was intended to be used for short runs between PWBs. I believe that the I2C spec calls for one twist every inch or so in the cable to reduce noise susceptibility. I was using the I2C bus for thruster control and had a thruster that was 18 inches from the controller. I had to reduce the I2C bus clock frequency from 100kHz to 75kHz to maintain consistent communication with the thruster.As an example, I have a test bench setup of just the wire harness, motors, and a IMU Module. When I kept the I2C bus wires at the original wire harness length, I saw the fluctuations in the pressure reading that you are experiencing. So I cut the test bench I2C bus wire harness wires to the shorter length that I cut them to on my ROV chassis. After shortening the I2C bus wires, the readings became stable.Regards,TCIII AVD"

Also, my IMU Module platform was parallel to the longitudinal axis of the ROV frame so it was level in the pitch axis.During the potting of the IMU Module in its case I found that the solder joints on the bottom of the Module were about 0.030 in high. So I cut a very small piece of 0.030 in thick abs plastic and CA‰Ûªed it on to the bottom of the opposite end of the Module pwb from the solder joints. This guaranteed that the pwb would be level in the acrylic case during the potting process.My understanding is that OROV plans to add an offset calibration function to the next Cockpit firmware release to correct for minor offsets in the IMU Module pitch and roll axes like you are experiencing.Regards,TCIII AVD"

Any misalignment of the DB-25 connector on the End Cap or a misalignment of the Pass-Though End Cap plates could cause the Controller Board to be misaligned in the WTC causing the O ring straps to contact the inside of the WTC?However, I just took a look at my 2.8 Controller Board with the new HD-Pro Camera Upgrade and determined that the O ring straps should not hit the inside of the WTC if the Camera Platform has been assembled and installed correctly on the Electronics Chassis.You can verify the correct assembly and installation of the Camera Platform in the Electronics Chassis by laying the Electronics Chassis with the camera facing down on a flat surface. If the Camera Platform has been assembled and installed correctly on the Electronics Chassis you should be able to manually swing the Camera Platform back and forth from its center position, while rotating the Electronics Chassis from side to side, without it contacting the flat surface. If the O rings are contacting the flat surface at any point in the swing of Camera Platform from its center position, then you may have some kind of assembly error in either the Camera Platform or the Electronics Chassis.Could you possibly provide some pictures of the Controller Board in the WTC and of the Pass-Through End Cap?Regards,TCIII AVD"

So the camera is obviously protruding too far forward.Then I remembered that while installing the camera platform on the chassis I had a lot of space between the ends of the platform and the chassis walls (going back through the build instructions it does state to make sure those end pieces on the camera platform are ‰ÛÏflush in both directions and at a 90 degree angle‰Ûù‰Û_maybe I didn‰Ûªt set them right)So I ended up putting an extra plastic nut between the chassis wall and the camera platform bracket as a spacer on the non-servo side.When I remove that ‰ÛÏspacer‰Ûù and tighten down the screws the two attachment legs of the camera platform pull slightly outwards toward the chassis walls, effectively pulling the front of camera back a little‰Û_just enough to give clearance.I didn‰Ûªt boot it up, but I could rotate the camera platform manually inside the tube so it should be fine.  I just hope the pressure on those end pieces doesn‰Ûªt translate into another problem down the road."

I‰Ûªd really like to be able to pilot this ROV to specific depths to collect water samples, so having a functional IMU is something important to me.This is OpenROV 2.8 #3251.  It is running running openrov-rov-suite - 30.0.3.jessie.204.531b22c.  This is the IMU/Depth Module that came with the kit this fall, so it should be version 2.0  (If you tell me how, I‰Ûªll check the version number to be sure.)  I‰Ûªm aware that this thread exists, but I‰Ûªm NOT having that issue; i.e. my IMU is not freezing during a dive.  Instead it never starts working.  The directional strip at the bottom of the cockpit is always reading ‰Û÷N‰Ûª and there‰Ûªs no depth reading.  That‰Ûªs always the case, whether or not I move the ROV around to calibrate it as @Brian_Grau demonstrated here.I suspect that I may be doing something wrong (meaning user issue, not hardware/software issue.)  I know the cockpit has a calibration button under diagnostics, but nothing appears to happen when I click it; there‰Ûªs no visual indication of a change in modes between operation and calibration modes.  How do I tell if I‰Ûªm in a calibration mode and what do I do if I enter one?   Am I supposed to log into the ROV and modify scripts to make this work?  Do I need to post a picture of the IMU so you can look at the wires??I‰Ûªve posted my status messages below.  Please note that there is nothing at all about  BNO055   Could this be soldered wrong?I‰Ûªve started this ROV with a chromebook and with laptops running microsoft (XP and Vista), and piloted it around near the surface using both keyboard controls and a game controller.

If so, then you might want to use the Cockpit to load the latest firmware to the Arduino Shield from the BBB.

I‰Ûªd check your power supply and make sure the voltage isn‰Ûªt sagging as the ROV boots up.  The ESCs need a fair amount of current when they switch on, your supply should be at least 3A or so for that to work.If you just want to test the ROV electronics, don‰Ûªt want to run off of batteries, and you don‰Ûªt have a high-current bench power supply, you can try jumpering across J17, the pads marked ‰ÛÏESC power switch‰Ûù.

Lawrence,"             2016-11-29 01:05:43 UTC           ","Short answer is don‰Ûªt do it.The longer answer is the higher voltage pack will charge the lower one and probably damage it.The Long answer is maybe if you put a reverse protection diode in each string so the higher voltage string can not discharge into the lower one and blow it up.  But then the diodes will have a voltage drop and need to be sized for current and you will draw 100% of your power from the higher voltage pack until it drops, then you will share for a little bit, then whichever one goes lower first will drop out and finally you will oscillate between the two.  You would never get double the power buy paralleling the battery packs.The complex answer is if each battery pack feeds it‰Ûªs own voltage regulator and they are setup in a master/slave configuration so they both maintain the same output voltage onto the power buss then it can work.  But at this point is probably cheaper to get two battery packs with the same chemistry batteries.One other thought, if you are paralleling two battery packs and they are physically separate you should ensure the connection is using  low resistance or equal resistance wire otherwise you will get something very similar to having packs of different voltage.Wires (a) should be the same size and length as wires (b).Bat 1 ----(a)-----+                  |                  ------ to powered device                  |Bat 2 ----(b)-----+"

Therefore attempting to use the OROV power system directly to power six T100s will not be possible and six OROV brushless motors will consume 10 amps more than the power system can supply.A solution to this problem is to use the OROV power system to power three of the thrusters and draw power directly from the batteries to power the other three thrusters bypassing the OROV power system.

However, you‰Ûªll probably find that the IR sensor that the Kinect uses for depth won‰Ûªt actually work underwater, since that frequency of light is quickly absorbed. See this picture:Absorption_spectrum_of_liquid_water.png1584x1036 85 KBAs you can see, there is only a small band of light that penetrates much at all, and that happens to be in the purple-blue-green area of the visible spectrum, depending on what type of water body you‰Ûªre in. Infrared light is severely attenuated, so  the depth camera on the Kinect which is in the Near IR range won‰Ûªt work very well, if at all, underwater.However! I read around a little bit and found two things that might challenge my claim. There is a paper which purports to have used a Kinect to scan surfaces under the surface of the water from above water, though I don‰Ûªt have access to it to read any more than its summary: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2669042There is also some talk in the OpenKinect google group that mentions the possibility of changing the Kinect‰Ûªs laser and IR filter to -possibly- make it work underwater, though it‰Ûªs probably no easy task and you still probably won‰Ûªt get very good results: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/openkinect/MyH9NPwFHOAMy suggestion is to check out using either a sonar sensor or stereocam setup to create depth maps for 3D mapping underwater. You can also use a single camera and photogrammetry techniques to achieve this as well. Check out this thread by @Scott_W:GoPro underwater Structure from Motion (SfM) / PhotogrammetrySurprisingly not, but better quality images will give better results, but if you limit the shots to what visibility is available it will still work basically as well as with good visibility (but higher off the wrecks with less shots) I have had results in water were I couldn‰Ûªt see my fins (they weren‰Ûªt fantastic but they worked) (in some ways it gave me a better feel for the site than what I saw with my own eyes)  The Colonist SfM was taken with about 3-4m visibility    [image] Whilst this s‰Û_"

Operation in very cold water will cause the wire and the wire insulation to stiffen and make epoxy start to become brittle.  I agree that the 2.6 configuration that you have does have some weaknesses.The OpenROV 2.8 wire harness and End Cap routing is about as good a sealing method that you can get if done properly. Being able to anchor the DB-25 connector to the entrance of the wire harness trough (I used CA Kicker around the flange of the DB-25 connector to ensure that the connector flange would bond quickly with the  CA spread around the periphery of the wire harness End Cap entrance) and then forcing the 2 Ton epoxy into the trough virtually guarantees an even distribution of epoxy around each individual wire and the elimination of all air pockets in the trough. Also, I found that routing the wires side by side in the trough instead of just a jumbled wire bundle helped to ensure that the epoxy coated all of the wires completely and forced the air out of the trough.I have built several 2.8 End Cap assemblies and have been able to pull a 560 mm Hg vacuum on the WTC for over two hours even without the ends of the wires in the wire harness being sealed. I have found that attention to detail in the application of the 2 Ton epoxy to the wire harness trough in the End Cap is very important for a good waterproof seal.Regards,TCIII AVD"

Unfortunately you might have to remove the BBB to be able to see the area of the board where those jumpers are located.If those solder jumpers are in place, then it might mean that the FET switch that is used to modulate the LEDs is not receiving a drive signal from the Arduino 2560 or heaven forbid the LED Cubes got wired up backwards during their manufacture.Also, did you mean software version 30.0.3 and not 3.0.3?Regards,TCIII AVD"

For the price, I figured it was worth trying out. When first starting cockpit, it works great. The frame rate is good, and the image is clearer in low light. However, the latency will jump dramatically after a few seconds. I also noticed that the CPU usage and ping are higher than usual. Everything is normal if I switch back to the Genius webcam.  The CPU usage on my PC is also higher than usual, but none of my cores are maxed. I plugged the camera into my computer, and there were no issues at all, so I don‰Ûªt think the camera is faulty.Considering this is a 720p camera, and the config.js setting is ‰Û÷SXGA‰Ûª, could the issue be with video scaling? Nowhere in the code could I find the definition for ‰Û÷SXGA‰Ûª, although I know this to be 1280x1024. What input format does the resolution option in config.js expect? What other possible causes might there be?@badevguru, considering that this camera is h.264 capable, I would be interested in testing the new HD-camera upgrade image with it to see if that would resolve my latency issue.

Eric_Stackpole,"             2016-10-03 03:32:55 UTC           ","Hi Peter,Sorry for the delay in getting back to you (and thank you, Brendan, for helping to answer some of these questions)!I‰Ûªve copied and pasted your questions below so I can answer in-line.1. For how long will the pre-sales campaign go on?We plan to continue pre-selling Tridents through the time we start shipping, but the pre-sale price may increase in the next month or two. An important thing to note is that we will be fulfilling pre-sales in the order they were placed, so earlier orders will receive their Trident earlier.2. Will the Trident be able to go in reverse? I assume that will be possible, but I can‰Ûªt remember seeing any videos where it does that. And I imagine that it will come in handy in some situations.Yep! All three thrusters on Trident are fully reversible, so the vehicle can move forward and backward, turn, and go up and down.3. If any of the parts (electrical or mechanical) in Trident stops working/breaks, will it be possible to open it up and change those, or do you have to throw the whole thing away and buy a new one? Because no matter how good the parts are, there is always a possibility of something breaking, and if everything is in a sealed case/cast you are pretty much screwed.(both questions answered below)4. Will you have any sorts of warranty? If yes, can you give some hint of what it will be like? Will I get a new Trident if it is not due to any ‰ÛÏpilot/driver failure‰Ûù?We are still working on the details of our repair and return policy, but we plan to stand by our product. One of the main focuses in the design of Trident has been to make it drastically more reliable than any other ROV on the market. That being said, if something does go wrong we want to make sure there is a reasonable solution for fixing it. Internal components most often fail due to mishandling and leaks, and for that reason the body of Trident is sealed at the factory to assure that that process is done correctly. In general, failures most often occur to moving parts such as motors, so in addition to making our thrusters as robust as possible, we‰Ûªve also designed them to be user-replaceable should the need occur.5. Will there be a gamepad/remote control included in the package, or do you have a list of which gamepads that will work with Trident?Trident can be controlled directly from any WiFi device it is connected to such as a smartphone, tablet, or laptop. We‰Ûªve developed our software to also allow external gamepads to be connected to these devices to give pilots a higher level of control sensitivity. For laptops, most USB gamepad controllers should work, but the most popular and affordable one people use for OpenROV is the Logitech F310. If you want the best of the best, my recommendation would be the Sony DualShock 4 PS4 controller. PS4 controllers are more expensive, but in our experience they are worth it. PS4 controllers also support bluetooth which can allow them to connect wirelessly to both laptops and mobile devices without USB.6. I have read that there will be different attachments available in the future (for example extra lights, grip claw etc.) Will most of those be available for purchase on your web page, or will that only be from third party ‰ÛÏdevelopers‰Ûù that I have to search for my self on the web?We plan to sell an array of payloads and accessories for Trident as OpenROV products in our store. Over time, we hope our catalog of available accessories as well as the sophistication of those accessories will increase. We also expect that you‰Ûªll also be able to find more niche payloads (such as sensors used for specific types of scientific research, etc) as 3rd party items that can be found elsewhere. Building a community and ecosystem around our platform is important to us, so we hope new ideas for payloads will be developed and shared here on our forums. We also plan to make parts and kits for developing custom payloads available in our store.7. Will it be possible to upgrade the software in Trident and will you continue develop it for better image quality, better accuracy in calculating the position of the Trident and also maybe add new features?Absolutely! We will constantly be working on improvements and new features for our software. We‰Ûªre also developing a way to make downloading and installing those updates as easy as possible. Many IOT devices today struggle with sending out new software to products that have already been shipped, but we hope to make Trident a device that can constantly be improved as development progresses.I hope these answer your questions, but please feel free to write back of there‰Ûªs anything else you‰Ûªd like to know about. We‰Ûªre really excited to be working on what we believe is the most functional and reliable underwater exploration tool in the world.Thanks!Eric"

I had enough free length to get it to shore, but I ended up having to cut the tether two feet from the openrov so I could recover the vehicle itself. I ended up having to leave a bit of cable in the lake, around 10m. Since I have to solder the cable back together, I want to make sure whatever I do doesn‰Ûªt degrade the strength of the cable too much.Questions:I saw another thread that mentioned waterproof connectors. Will installing these impact the pull strength of the tether? http://www.dx.com/p/maitech-2-copper-core-waterproof-connector-terminal-head-black-314033#.VXHGtc9VhBcIf I just join the cables with solder and heat shrink tubing, will that create a noticeable weak spot in the tether?If I do just solder it together, should I put mesh/electrical tape/something else around the join to spread the load when pulling the ROV up?I did learn some interesting lessons from this, so others: don‰Ûªt repeat my mistake. Docks in the PNW (I‰Ûªd assume else where also) have tons of old crap (fallen pilings, previous dock materials) on the bottom near them, and no matter how cool something is, don‰Ûªt land on the bottom and then move forward. I‰Ûªm pretty sure I was fine until the proximity to the bottom and jerking forward caused the line itself to move under an old, fallen piling and catch.I‰Ûªd also love to hear other people‰Ûªs approach to following the tether back down, especially from shore.

Is was about 3 meters away and I had to swim out and cut the cable.To fix it you want to go back to the instructions for attaching the tether and re-attach it again.  Remove the short tail that you have and get back to the wires that emerge from the tube, where you originally soldered the tether.  You need the cable to be wrapped around the long zip tie and the solder joint to have no strain at all.I have also upgraded to the water proof connector that you highlighted.  It is very strong and can certainly support the weight of the ROV.  When I have wanted to be really sure of the strength I have also tied the cable through the carry handle, after the water proof connector.  Then I know that I am pulling on that knot rather than on the coupling.  It is probably not needed though.  Someone should do a test and demonstrate that the join and connector is stronger than the cable itself."

Typically, the second you move, shake, or otherwise change the state of the IMU, it starts to calibrate itself into a nominally working state. What you are likely seeing with the 5 degree error is that you haven‰Ûªt mounted the sensor perfectly horizontally with respect to the roll axis.Back in October, I wrote a small plugin/command that allowed you to zero the roll and pitch from the cockpit, but I don‰Ûªt think I ever merged it into the current release. I‰Ûªll find that code and merge it into the 30.0.4 release that we are currently working on and that will allow you to hit a key on the keyboard to zero your IMU at will. In the new feature release that we are working on (30.1.x), we will also be adding a way to save these settings for your vehicle so those offsets are by default loaded at runtime. I‰Ûªll provide instructions here soon for getting those updates.In the mean time, if you want to manually adjust for that error, you can do this at lines 300-303 in CMPU9150.cpp:NDataManager::m_navData.PITC = ( MPU.m_fusedEulerPose[VEC3_Y] * RAD_TO_DEGREE ) + <pitchErrorOffset>;NDataManager::m_navData.ROLL = ( MPU.m_fusedEulerPose[VEC3_X] * RAD_TO_DEGREE ) + <rollErrorOffset>;In your case, with an error of 5.0 degrees:NDataManager::m_navData.ROLL = ( MPU.m_fusedEulerPose[VEC3_X] * RAD_TO_DEGREE ) + (-5.0f);If you are using the BNO055 (OpenROV‰Ûªs IMU2), your change would be at the bottom of CBNO055.cpp as such:NDataManager::m_navData.PITC    = euler.z() + <pitchErrorOffset>;NDataManager::m_navData.ROLL    = -euler.y() + <rollErrorOffset>;Let me know if you have any further issues and look out for the updates."

I easily get 720/25fps with very low latency and can even do 1080, although my laptop screen resolution isn‰Ûªt high enough.I cannot recall what the OpenROV 2.8 uses but I am pretty sure it does not have inbuilt H264 encoding, thus requiring the beaglebone to do some processing.I would imagine the new HD camera being offered has some solution to provide high speed encoding as well as superior low light sensitivity.

The camera encodes into an H.264 stream which decreases the latency and reduces the CPU load on the BeagleBone Black. The camera has a high dynamic range to handle high contrast situations and works much better in low light situations. The lens and focus is also set to match the sensor and the underwater environment. We have spent a lot of time on the design of this camera (for Trident as well as for the 2-series) because we know this is the most important sensor on the vehicle.Having flown with both cameras I find the new one much better. While the image quality is better the biggest difference is in the latency. We have been working to reduce it as much as possible and makes the vehicle much more responsive because when you give a control command you get very fast visual feedback of the change in direction.

charlesdc,"             2016-08-26 18:04:43 UTC           ","Hi @pazrul,This is caused by the fact that the OpenROV 2.8 only has one vertical thruster. I‰Ûªm sure someone more mechanically inclined can provide a better/more detailed explanation than the following, but the basic reason is this:When a prop spins in some fluid, be it air or water, depending on which way it is turning, it creates two primary forces. The first is the force along the axis about which the propeller rotates, and the other is a torque opposite to the direction of the rotation of the prop, on the body to which the thruster is attached (in this case your ROV). For vehicles such as quadrotors and helicopters, there are additional props which provide a countertorque to prevent rotation of the vehicle as a result of this. On quadrotors, two of the props rotate in the opposite direction to allow for fine control and balancing of the rotational forces on the vehicle. If you slow down one set of rotors and speed up the others, you can maintain altitude while rotating the vehicle. For helicopters without counter rotating vertical rotors, the tail rotor is what provides the ability to counter this torque and also give you control of the vehicle‰Ûªs yaw.As the OpenROV only has one vertical rotor, there is no counter to the torque, and that is why you see the rotation when you go up and down. However, you can use the port and starboard thrusters to counter the torque. As you have the IMU, you can put the vehicle into heading hold while you ascend and descend and it should help to counter the twisting."

charlesdc,"             2016-08-29 04:18:51 UTC           ","@TCIII @pazrul @bokum,I‰Ûªm currently the primary engineer/developer in charge of the embedded software, ESCs, controls, etc. I joined OpenROV just over a year ago, and have mostly focused on Trident development (cameras, new microcontroller, Raspberry Pi, etc), though I have done quite a bit of refactoring on the firmware side of things. When I reworked a lot of the firmware, I made the decision to let the controls side of things for the 2.X series sit on the backburner, mainly because I knew that I would eventually be developing a new system for the Trident. Part of the work I‰Ûªm doing now is the development of a new set of control schemes which are mainly applicable to Trident, but will also likely serve as a significant upgrade to the 2.X series as well (or at least those equipped with the IMU+Depth sensor).The primary mode of control that we are imagining the Trident to be piloted with is two controllers working together which can interchangeably be absolute position or rate controllers. For example, The depth controller can be set in absolute position mode, while the yaw controller can be set in rate mode, allowing the user to maintain a constant depth without needing to touch the controls, while the yaw/throttle axes of the joystick can be used to manoeuvre in a 2D plane. When you let go of the joystick, you will be essentially commanding a 0 deg/s yaw rate, which will drive the control system to bring you to a stop. You could also put the yaw controller in absolute mode, and it will maintain a fixed heading (to the best of the sensor‰Ûªs abilities to estimate the heading). In absolute mode, you have the option to lock the control such that yaw inputs on the gamepad don‰Ûªt affect it any more, or allow the setpoint to be modified by the controller in a sort of ‰ÛÏcarrot on a stick‰Ûù control scheme. In general, we expect that most people will prefer to control the depth with a modifiable setpoint, in the same way that depth lock works on the 2.X series, while the yaw mode will vary depending on the user‰Ûªs preferences and the situation.This development is important for the 2.X as well, because it currently does not have a rate controller, and the vertical and horizontal control planes are currently entirely decoupled, so short of using the existing heading and depth lock controls, you can‰Ûªt achieve isolated vertical control. Arguably, because of the uncertainty in the sensors we have, the arrangement of the thrusters, the unknown underwater dynamics, propeller dynamics, and more, you can never achieve perfect control along any given control surface with the 2.X series (or any vehicle), but with a proper control allocation step, we can improve the situation.The new control software that I will be working on will feature the following to hopefully achieve a flexible and more complete set of control mechanisms:A thruster abstraction which contains information about the thruster‰Ûªs capabilities, physical properties, and orientationAn Allocator stage which relates and mixes input signals pertaining to principle axes of control (yaw, pitch, x, z) to thruster signals for a given thruster arrangement (similar to our current concept of the CThrusters2x1 class in the arduino firmware)A rate controller (PID or something else) which maps input signals (from a gamepad or another control system) to desired velocities along principle axesA position controller which maps input signals to desired absolute positions (mainly only achievable for yaw and depth with a three thruster setup).An allocation stage which includes a model of the vertical thruster‰Ûªs effect on the yaw axis combined with a rate controller allowing only user requested yaw inputs, should be the answer to eliminate the twist while not having to put the vehicle in heading hold, as addressed in this thread. Once the Trident implementations are mature and tested, I will definitely be looking into bringing the 2.X series in line. That said, we certainly encourage anyone to feel free to write a new CThruster configuration or CAutopilot implementation in the current firmware and give a shot at tackling the problem.We are also completely open to discussing new control schemes and methods going forward, so feel free to voice any ideas you might like to see explored. Having so few sensors inputs, so many unknowns, and strange, unmodeled dynamics, precise control of the 2.X is a tricky subject which will probably require some clever thinking to tackle beyond what I‰Ûªve got planned."

The effect has not correlation with the thruster rotating in some kind of fluid but also works perfectly well in vacuum. Imagine an OpenROV flying without gravitation on the ISS (space station). Once you power a thruster, the prop will start rotating. Because of the counter momentum the whole ROV will turn in the opposite direction, maintaining the momentum equilibrium (overall the momentum of the vehicle is constant)."

However If I set the light control on full (9.5v) and plug the lights in, the voltage drops from the 9.5v to around 1.65v (no lights). Its like the board cannot supply enough current to drive the lights.

Starting from the (+) battery bus (called V_BAT on the schematic), current goes through R28, to PWM1+, returns via PWM1-, and then through Q4 to ground.  I‰Ûªd take a voltmeter with one side connected to a ground test point.  With the LEDs plugged in, turn the lights on full in software, and then probe at all of these points.  If you‰Ûªre only getting around 1.6V across the LED board (PWM1+ to PWM1-), then there must be about 8V of drop somewhere else.

What is happening to cause that is that the openrov_config.sh script in /opt/openrov/cockpit/linux/ is unable to detect which controller board you are on. It checks that by trying to communicate to the ATmega2560 over the SPI port. If you have altered your linux setup in a way that makes the SPI port inaccessible, or if your controllerboard is damaged in some way that damages the ATMega or the SPI bus, the script will fail to detect the arduino. Since that version of the software still supports the Cape setup, it will assume that a lack of Arduino on the SPI port means you must be connected to an Arduino ATMega328p on the cape, and will attempt to build the firmware for that target. The 328p does not have an A8 pin, so the compilation will fail in the manner you are seeing.In summary, you may have a damaged controllerboard or you may have inadvertently compromised your SPI interface on the BBB and may want to contact support."

With wet/damp hands a small zap that you would easily survive on dry land could easily kill you. It only takes a few mA through the heart to die and water rapidly lowers the resistance of the human body.

They had two conductors, I guess around 2.5 sqr mm for power and a twisted pair for feedback from the vehicle in the tether. The twisted pair then feed back actually voltage at vehicle to the surface powersupply.I guess you could easy make up a power unit using a lawn mower motor and a car alternator. The feedback would then feed the subsea voltage back up to the regulator. The alternator output would then become 14 volts plus the voltage drop in the cable.This would provide unlimited dive time and independency from the grid.I strongly recommend installing a DC/dc converter subsea to power the fragile electronics."

Our diver dropped into pool to grab the equipment. He took hold of an endcap. This end cap came loose and we flooded the tube with pool water (chlorinated). We unplugged as soon as possible (within a few moments of breach).We have taken these steps, within 30 mins flushed the electronics with distilled water. Used pressurized air to blowout all the visible moisture. Disassembled the major parts and flushed them again with 99.9% Isopropanol. Used pressurized air again to dry again.I am planning to put (visibly) dry components in bags with desiccant as soon as they are blown out.Is there any other advice on trying to mitigate the damage?"
Walt_Holm,"             2016-06-29 16:39:52 UTC           ","You‰Ûªve taken pretty good steps so far.  When you say you‰Ûªve disassembled the major parts, make sure that you take the electronics fully apart- take the BBB and the homeplug adapter off of the controller board, and the RJ-45 cable off as well.  The isopropanol flush should have a low enough viscosity to get into all the connector sockets to dry them out.  Also, on the camera, unscrew the lens and check for moisture in the lens holder.While flushing stuff, make sure you flush out the electronics endcap with the DB-25 connector!  That endcap is the hardest single piece of the ROV to replace (it‰Ûªs pretty much the heart of the ROV), so it‰Ûªs important that it gets rinsed and dried as soon as possible.Packing components in desiccant is OK, but you might want to also try an oven.  Start up the oven, set it to as low a temperature as it will go (maybe something like 170 degrees F), and wait a bit for the oven to stabilize at the low temperature.  Then pop all your electronics in the oven.  The high heat will evaporate any residual moisture much faster than desiccant at room temperature will.  You might want to leave the oven door cracked to allow moisture to escape.The reason I say to wait before stuffing things in the oven is that some ovens (mine, for one) will overshoot in temperature when they start up.  You don‰Ûªt want to melt the plastic pieces in the electronics!Let us know how things go.-W"

If the visibility is poor ( a few meter or less) very bright lights may make it even worse.  Unless the lights are placed properly (spaced as far apart as possible) too much light will reflect off the suspended particles and back to the camera.The Lynn video system is basically a video post processor.  I‰Ûªve accomplished something similar using RoboRealm ( http://www.roborealm.com/ ) but the results will depend on a number of factors and may not be sufficient for your purposes.What you really need in poor visibility is sonar.

I‰Ûªm new to underwater SFM , though I‰Ûªve done some work around (VO)Visual Odometry and semi-dense scene reconstructions on the KITTI dataset (mostly based on minimizing 3D-2D reprojection errors). I‰Ûªm not sure how well the standard techniques would work underwater. Is there some good literature on this ?I‰Ûªd be very interested to see if we can make use of stereo setups for underwater VO.  There are some open source solutions like libviso2 which I have been trying to improve using a version of rao blackwellised particle filter with visual odometric motion model. If the standard model holds underwater with some corrections, this can pave way for improved navigation and drift correction on the openrov itself.I also came across Prof. Blair Thornton‰Ûªs work (http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335440 ) where they used a mapping device consisting of a camera and sheet laser. The idea there was to have the sheet laser in the camera‰Ûªs FOV and extract 3D points corresponding to the laser line for a bathymetric model. The color information was recovered on a per pixel basis from the camera for the 3D points by accounting for the motion which was recovered from the navigation information.If there are any datasets available, I‰Ûªd love to look into this myself.Regards,Akshay"

Walt_Holm,"             2016-06-13 17:33:21 UTC           ","So in the past we‰Ûªve been telling people not to put a pair of light cubes on any individual PWM channel of a Controller Board 2.6 or earlier.  The PWM channels were designed for about 1 Amp maximum, and the programming resistors (R24-R35) are size 0603 to reflect this.  A pair of light cubes draws about 1.5 amps.This morning I reviewed the trace sizes used to carry power within the PWM circuitry, and I think you‰Ûªll be OK as long as you use a programming jumper that can handle the current.  A stock 0603 0-ohm resistor is only rated for 1 amp, but if you use, say, a small chunk of 22-ga solid wire, I think you‰Ûªll be fine.So I think in your case, what I would do is to solder a small piece of solid copper wire (22 gauge or so) across the pads of R32, which will bring battery voltage out on the PWM3 channel.  Then wire the PWM3+ and PWM3- to the appropriate test pads just below the DB-25 connector.  Note that on the 2.6 and earlier boards the traces between the test pads and the DB-25 pins are really marginal for driving two light cubes, and it would be good if you would beef them up with some additional wire.You can, as you suggest, use PWM2 to drive a light cube, rather than the lasers.  To do that you need to remove R28 and put a jumper into R29, and then run wires from PWM2+ and PWM2- to the appropriate test pads and external wiring.Let us know how your mods go.-W"

Walt_Holm,"             2016-05-26 16:26:28 UTC           ","Hi Katie:So the part of the schematic you need is Sheet 3.  The power supply switching happens with optocoupler OC1, MOSFET Q1, and the components in between.When a DC voltage is applied to the tether, optocoupler OC1 pulls the gate of Q1 down near ground, turning it on and allowing current to flow.  If your robot is on without power being on the tether, then either Q1 got fried somehow, there is a short on the board somewhere, or something else is pulling the gate of Q1 low.OC1 is located on the corner of the board opposite of the DB-25 connector.  Next to it is jumper slot J12, which can be used to manually turn on the robot.  As Nima mentioned earlier, there should not be any jumper soldered in the J12 position.  With batteries in the robot but no connection to the tether (the ROV should be erroneously turned on right now)  measure the voltage across the two pins of J12.  On a good robot you should see something close to battery voltage (say ~9V).  If OC1 is improperly turned on you‰Ûªll see maybe 0.8V or so, and if there‰Ûªs a short here you might see something that is essentially 0 volts.Let us know what you find and we‰Ûªll move on from there.-W"

When you had the short-circuit on the light board, that‰Ûªs when Q4 probably fried.  You can see Q4 on sheet 6 of the schematic.Maybe the short-circuit that damaged Q4 also damaged Q1, the main power switch.  Can you remember whether the ROV turned on the very first time you put batteries in it, before you had attached the topside tether connection?Anyway, please go ahead and look at the voltage across J12.  If it‰Ûªs something close to battery voltage,but the ROV is powered on,  then Q1 is likely damaged.-W"

With batteries in the robot but the USB cable disconnected (the ROV should erroneously be on at this point), measure the voltage between pins 1 and 2.  It should be 0 with the USB cable disconnected.

Trying to turn lasers on causes battery to drop to 0V then camera will not work - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,
katieclevenger02,"             2016-05-17 19:44:36 UTC           ","I have completed building the OpenROV 2.8 and have succesfully gotten the Cockpit, camera, and motors to work. The issues begin when I try to turn on the lasers. When I type ‰ÛÏL,‰Ûù it causes the battery voltage to briefly drop to 0 volts which causes the ROV to reboot. After rebooting, the voltage goes back to normal, but the camera image on the Cockpit goes black and will not resume until I reboot the ROV again. In addition to this, unplugging the USB cable does not power down the ROV. I have to pull the batteries out. I am in a bit of a time crunch to get this ROV finished, so I can use it for my thesis. Any help is greatly appreciated.I have already tried updating the Beagle Backbone with 30.0.3. I also updated the firmware. All three lights on the homeplug connect either light up or blink."
Walt_Holm,"             2016-05-17 20:58:09 UTC           ","The symptoms you describe for the lasers are generally caused by either a short-circuit in the soldering on the light board, or a mixup in inserting the four wires from the laser board into the headers on the Control Board.I would start by checking over all the wiring and looking closely at the solder joints on the light board to make sure that there are no shorts.  If you don‰Ûªt find any issues, disconnect the four light board wires from the controller board, and start testing while you incrementally plug stuff back in.  With no wires connected, does pressing L cause the ROV to reboot?  Then just install the two wires for the lights.   Do the lights work correctly?  does pressing L cause the ROV to reboot?  Then finally reinstall the two wires for the lasers.  Do the lasers now work correctly, or do they cause the ROV to reboot?By breaking down the problem like this, you should be able to find the cause pretty quickly.Once you have dealt with the lasers issue, we can move on to the power switch issue. That one will probably require the use of a voltmeter to diagnose.-W"

Walt_Holm,"             2016-05-18 17:36:38 UTC           ","@Fe3C Good point about the light board screws, although it doesn‰Ûªt sound like that‰Ûªs the issue here.The original light boards for 2.8 had an issue where if you tightened the camera screws too tight, it would cause a short in the wiring and could lead to power shorting issues.  This was fixed around December of 2015 with the ‰ÛÏA‰Ûù revision of the light board (It says 2.8A on the back), which cut back the copper pour around the screw holes.  If you have an original version of the 2.8 light board, you need to be careful about either not overtightening the camera screws, or add a nylon washer or other insulating material underneath the head of the screw.  I think there‰Ûªs something about this in the Dozuki instructions, but I‰Ûªm not sure.@katieclevenger02 let us know if you still have issues with the ROV being on all the time.-W"

I have zero experience with builds like this, so the out-of-the-box Trident is appealing, but on the other hand the ability to modify and add components seem a lot more limited.  When researching these forums a bit, I wasn't able to find any information on the future plans for the DIY kits.

These are all included in the adventure set.We do not include batteries with the kit because many people prefer to source their own batteries that meet the requirements to power the ROV. This can be for a variety of reasons but one of the biggest ones is due to import restrictions in some countries."

You will also need batteries that can source enough current to run the motors. Standard alkaline batteries will not be able to do this (even if they have a high enough voltage). My recommendation would be to either purchase batteries from our store, or find comparable batteries from a supplier close to you. Here is a link to the specifications of our batteries.  You are going to want size 26650 batteries with a high continuous discharge current. The battery chemistry LiFePO4 is the most stable and very safe and reliable."

Walt_Holm,"             2016-03-30 23:19:10 UTC           ","Shaughan:If your BBB is attached to the Controller Board, you should power it with the controller board.  If you‰Ûªve detached the BBB from the controller board, there are a number of different ways that you can power it, but a USB cable is probably the easiest.I looked at the Step 11 for the Software Update procedure.  Yes, it‰Ûªs a bit confusing.  I‰Ûªm assuming that Brian will change it.The problem with powering the BBB with USB while its attached to the controller board is that you‰Ûªre putting power onto a number of lines on the controller board, without the controller board itself being powered.  The two primary areas are the UART level shifter, and the 5V input pins on the BBB.So I did some research to see what the vulnerability of both those areas are.On the BBB, there is an NCP349 input voltage protection circuit on the 5V input (the 5V input pins on the expansion headers, and the 5V barrel connector), that will switch off the input whenever it‰Ûªs outside the range of ~3.5V -5.5V.  That‰Ûªs good, as it means that power won‰Ûªt backflow from the USB power rail to the 5V rail (and from there to the 5V circuits on the controller board) if the BBB is being powered by USB.The UART level shifter (a Texas Instruments TXB0108- part U7 on the controller schematic) is a little trickier.   It‰Ûªs supposed to be able to withstand having only one side of the chip powered, but TI only guarantees this if the OE is not enabled.  Unfortunately, as soon as the BBB starts up it enables the OE pin of the level converter.  From a casual look at the datasheet, I can‰Ûªt tell you exactly what happens at that point.So, bottom line, what happens if you power the BBB via the USB cable, while it‰Ûªs attached to the Controller Board?  I don‰Ûªt know, since I‰Ûªve never run any formal tests of that case.At this point I‰Ûªd just continue working with tech support to try to resolve whatever‰Ûªs going on with your ROV.-W"

Brian_Grau,"             2016-04-09 00:16:52 UTC           ","As a first time ROV user first I would like to welcome you to the community.There are a couple of things that I can think of with regard to the camera freezing.First, there is an ongoing issue with camera in high contrast situations pausing. This same freezing has seen with complicated grid patterns (like the tiling on the sides of pools). When the servo moves the camera up or down the image can sometimes become too complicated for it to process and it has issues. If you can run the same test you have been doing where it freezes, but hold a towel or something in front to give it a simple background and not as bright of surrounding light and see if it continues to freeze.If the camera continues to freeze then it could be a mechanical issue with the wire. I have seen the white wire that connects the camera to the BBB have issues that cause the signal to drop out. If the camera continues to freeze in the above situation you can run a test on the wire. If you remove the camera from the rest of the ROV and then plug it into your laptop you should be able to view the image with a standard webcam viewer. If you play around with the wire see if the video cuts out. If it does cut out then it is more than likely this connecting wire.With regard to the dive alert you are getting - This software was written very roughly a while ago and does give useful information but it was never dialed in to exact specifications. Sometimes the alerts go off more often than they should. You should check the motors that there is nothing interfering with them. If this problem continues to persist in the water we would love to know about it because the feedback on it is good."
danmandusputer,"             2016-04-09 13:40:52 UTC           ","So, it seems the issue is now resolved.  You were correct in your assumption about the white wire from the camera to the BBB.  I unplugged the wire from the back of the camera and re-seated it/plugged it back in.  Looks like it had come out just enough.  After doing so, the camera moves up and down without freezing.  FPS increased a little as well.  I should‰Ûªve checked that connection to begin with.  Thanks very much!!"

shruti.145,"             2016-04-21 03:04:47 UTC           ","Hi,My group is working with the OpenROV 2.8 and we‰Ûªre trying to add additional camera(s) to the system as payloads. We intend on running those cameras with a beaglebone black and have to figure out how to power the microcontroller. Our approach to this problem is to use the tenda powerline adapter to power the beaglebone and supply it with Ethernet. I know that the topside tenda adapter provides Ethernet to the beaglebone on the ROV, I was wondering if it also supplies power. My search through the forum provided a vague conclusion, that no power is being supplied. However, I wanted to confirm this.Thanks,Shruti"

The electric components of the OpenROV solely rely on the two redundant battery tubes. The tether establishes a DLAN ethernet connection between the top box and the ROV. Supplying power over the tether has been discussed in a variety of threads here on the forum and comes with a variety of advantages and drawbacks (example). As far as I know some hackers have successfully used the tether as a power supply."

Such a change would also allow cockpit.js being shutdown (greatly freeing up CPU, potentially for other exciting things), while maintaining controllability of the vehicle.Somewhat related: regardless of what architecture y‰Ûªall converge on, I hope it would maintain the ability at the ZeroMQ level to command the individual motors (e.g. currently possible via  deps.rov.send('port(x)') ). I don‰Ûªt see any reason why this would change, but wanted to throw it out there as I think cockpit sends thrust/yaw msgs, with thruster allocation math done on the MCU."

I am now confused about this process. For example, how the NCommManger ‰ÛÏknows‰Ûù that it should sent the command string to the CThruster2x1 but not the Clight  if the command does for the motor.(somehow like an identification check).I don‰Ûªt know wheather my undrstanding is proper.Thanks a lot."
charlesdc,"             2016-04-25 16:34:05 UTC           ","@GoldenSorry, that is likely because of how I drew the arduino side of the chart. As you have found, that function in the comm manager basically parses in a command from the serial line (or attempts to) on each update loop. Once it has a complete message, it switches that commandAvailable flag to true. The comm manager is available to all other modules in the code, so after the comm manager finishes it‰Ûªs update loop, the update loops for all of the CModule-derived classes get called and if they are listening for messages, they will check to see if a message was available and, if so, whether or not  the command name matches one they are interested in. The comm manager never sends the thruster messages, but rather it serves as a shared mailbox that all of the modules can check during one update loop cycle. It‰Ûªs a bit inefficient as each module is doing a string comparison to see if the message is for them, and also the comm manager is spending a lot of time trying to parse strings as well, but that is what I hope to address with using a binary serialization like mavlink. With mavlink, parsing will become more of a ‰ÛÏcheck the message type ID and destructure into a c struct‰Ûù process, so everything should become integer comparisons as opposed to full string comparisons. This also should buy back cpu cycles on the BBB.Also, the reasons for why we use the shared mailbox approach are that the mcu is generally running fast enough to only have one complete command buffered at any time, so we can just process it and be done with it, and there is limited SRAM available on these mcus, so we have to be careful how much memory we allocate to making copies of messages. In our case, there is no need to send copies of messages to each module that is interested when we can just signal them to look at the one we parsed exactly where it resides in memory."

How deep can we go at altitude? - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,
craig2,"             2016-03-26 15:23:07 UTC           ","Hi, Community!I am new to the forums, so forgive me if I breach some element of protocol.  I am a mentor for a team of high school students building an OpenROV for use in studying frogs in Lake Titicaca.  It is a joint project between a zoo and team of biologists in Peru and Bolivia and the Denver Zoo and St Vrain Valley schools in the US.  You can find our expedition described in the community.  The question we want to answer is ‰ÛÏHow deep can we safely take the OpenROV in a freshwater lake at 12,500 feet?‰Ûù.  Our own calculations are below.  We‰Ûªd like to have someone else double check them, as we‰Ûªd hate to have an implosion once we get down there.The OpenROV rover is designed to dive to 100M in salt water at sea level.  As such, the rover is supplied with a tether that is 100M in length.  For depth, the limiting factor is the pressure differential between the ambient air pressure at the surface of the water and the pressure at depth.  The pressure vessel that contains the electronics is sealed at the surface of the water (lake, ocean, etc.).  That effectively sets the internal pressure of the vessel (Pa, or pressure of the ambient atmosphere).  Once the vessel is submerged, the outside of the vessel is subject to the combined pressure of the atmosphere above the surface of the water PLUS the pressure due to the weight of the water column above the vessel (Pd, or pressure at depth).  At sea level, Pa is one atmosphere, or 14.7psi.  At 12,500 feet (altitude of Lake Titicaca), the atmospheric pressure is 9.16psi, or about 62% of the pressure at sea level.  This means that the pressure inside the vessel will be significantly less at our target site than it is for the normal (sea level) usage of the OpenRov.To calculate the pressure at depth, we need to know the density of the water.  The US Navy uses different densities for fresh water and salt water.  For sea water, they use 0.445psi per foot of depth.  For fresh water, they use 0.433psi per foot of depth.  The OpenROV design depth is 100M in salt water, or 328 feet.  At that depth, the pressure due to the water (Pw) is:Pw = 328 feet * 0.445 psi/ft = 145.96 psiThe total pressure at depth is thereforePd = Pa + Pw = 14.7 psi + 145.96 psi = 160.66 psiNow the big question.  What causes leaks to occur in the pressure vessel?  It is (we believe) seepage of the water impinging on the O-rings.  Water seeps into the gaps in the acrylic vessel until it reaches the seal made by the O-ring.  The o-ring provides a mechanical connection squeezed into place by the tight-fitting acrylic end cap inserted into the cylinder of the vessel body.  The design depth of the OpenROV would indicate that the O-ring can protect the contents of the pressure vessel up to a pressure differential ofPd - Pa = Pw, or 145.96 psi.This equation shows that the pressure differential is simply the weight of the water column at depth. In other words, the pressure differential isPd ‰ÛÒ Pa = (Pa + Pw) ‰ÛÒ Pa = Pw. If this is indeed the case, for Lake Titicaca (at 12,500 feet) the reduced atmospheric pressure has essentially no physical effect on the pressure differential.  To determine how deep we can go, we simply need to know how deep 145.96psi is in fresh water.  That calculation is simply:Max depth in fresh water = 145.96 psi / 0.433 psi/foot = 337 feet.So, unexpectedly for me, I find the maximum depth to be greater in fresh water at altitude than it is for salt water at sea level.  From a safety perspective, the 328 foot tether will effectively limit the rover to a safe depth.Now, I believe the math is correct, but when I double check this number against human dive tables, I find the equivalent dive depth for humans is only 210 feet.  This is directly proportional to the depth at which the pressure on the body increases by the pressure at the water‰Ûªs surface (33 feet at sea level, 21 feet at 12,500 feet).  I believe this has more to do with nitrogen narcosis and the lower atmospheric pressure effects of preventing the bends than it does with the simple physics of maintaining a consistent maximum pressure differential.  However, we could be wrong.  If we‰Ûªre actually looking at a maximum pressure ratio (Pd/Pa), we get a much different answer (230 ft maximum depth).  This approach, though, does not seem consistent with the physics.  So, the question is, should we base our maximum depth on a consistent maximum pressure differential (as in the calculation above) or do we need to base it on a consistent pressure ratio (outside pressure to inside pressure)?I look forward to your insights and guidance, as they are most welcome.  Thanks in advance.Craig"
Fe3C,"             2016-03-27 08:34:42 UTC           ","Welcome to OpenROV!Your project sounds extremely interesting and I look forward to more updates about your progress.Your pressure calculations look correct and operation in fresh water usually allows for a greater depth, but I have some suggestions. In general these figures are very theoretical. The actual maximum depth that an OpenROV can resist heavily depends on a variety of factors, such as built quality, lubricant and sealing quality, temperature of the air inside the tubes, quality of acryl and many more. Also you have to look at a variety of different failures at depth. This can be leaks, but as you wrote also implosion. These occur at different depths for the different tubes. So overall it is quite hard to define a depth at which the ROV fails.The official 100m depth stat is a safe calculations that allows for safe operation under normal conditions. However, some ROVs have been taken significantly deeper. If you use an OpenROV that is correctly built, you should be fine with your plan."
Eric_Stackpole,"             2016-03-27 20:00:59 UTC           ","Just echoing Fe3C‰Ûªs comment.  Your math looks pretty good to me but there are some other factors that need to be considered.  As an easy-to-remember rule of thumb, it just so happens to work out that in metric units, the pressure from altitude change (in air) and depth change (in water) are both very close to multiples of ten in relation to pressure: 1m of depth = ~10 kPa (~0.1 atm) of pressure increase and 1000m of altitude = 10 kPa (~0.1atm) of pressure decrease (when at non-extreme altitudes).  In other words, you can expect the equivalent of about 1m less water pressure for every 1000m altitude you‰Ûªve gained.  12500ft (almost 4000m) will result in water pressure equivalent to being about 4m shallower at sea level‰Û_ BUT‰Û_ if you‰Ûªve opened or equalized your vehicle while at this altitude (which I suggest you do in order to keep the o-ring seated in the right direction so it doesn‰Ûªt leak when you pass through equalization at 4m depth), all bets are off.  All of these calculations assume gauge pressure, not absolute pressure.  Without the original 100kPa atmospheric pressure inside (at Lake Titicaca, the ambient pressure should be around 63kPa), gauge pressure at true depth goes back to the same value.The other points Fe3C made were also very good.  It turns out that the temperature of the water is also a major factor in performance.  I don‰Ûªt have empirical data for the tubes in v2.8 (which are thicker), but when I was validating the design of the 2-series, I did a series of tests to check performance of some weaker tubes we had in ice water in preparation for expeditions going to Antarctica.  The spread is fairly wide, but as you can see, the statistical difference in failure pressure between room temperature and freezing water is about 12 psi or 83 kPa.  A warm tube will have noticeably less strength than a cold one.Tube Failure Data.png1469x850 75.9 KBLong story short,  if you want to go deep, the best situation is to be in cold, fresh water with a carefully built ROV.Good luck with your expedition and please keep us posted with how it goes!~Eric"
Fe3C,"             2016-03-29 20:44:24 UTC           ","I can share a pressure related experience from today. I was diving at a height of 700m (see this post for a full report) and for some reason (excitement?) I forgot everything we talked about in this thread.I can confirm that a tube closed at sea level, will eventually pop open, if heated from inside, even when under water (very dangerous!). I was lucky enough to quickly recover the ROV before significant leaks happened. Secondly, the IMU pressure sensors is based on sea level pressure, so it has a measurement error. In line with Eric‰Ûªs argumentation there is an offset of about (1 meter depth measurement)/(1000 meter height to sea level). This might be useful for high altitude dives."

To figure out which it is, remove the batteries from Battery Tube 1 (the good side), and try to power your ROV.  If it powers up, check the telemetry for both channels, and see whether both are reading zero.  If that‰Ûªs the case, then the telemetry circuit is bad.If the ROV does not power up, then there‰Ûªs something wrong between the DB-25 connector, through the Channel 2 blocking diode, and onto the ROV battery bus.Once you‰Ûªve narrowed the problem down, you can then decide what further action to take.-Walt"

If one motor is a little stiffer, it is not necessarily the end of its life. If you run the ROV in the water it might turn out not to be an issue at all since the water resistance evens out the differences between the motors.I would recommend getting another set of motors (and you can replace it now) or just to have as a spare in case the motor does freeze up and stop working.

If it is near 100% then that could indicate that the lighting conditions are straining the camera on the USB port causing a large number of hardware interrupts.

I recently built an OpenROV 2.8 which worked fine after building it and I was able to take on several dives. It began behaving strangely after unplugging the electronics from the end cap and replacing them, wiping down the acrylic tube and sealing everything up.I connected the ROV to my laptop to test if all was well before taking it on a dive.  I heard the typical power up beep and the lights and lasers were flashing, but found that the cockpit & dashboard would not load.After much refreshing, resetting my network settings and restarting the topside box it still would not work. I unplugged the topside box usb and ethernet cables from my computer, and strangely the ROV did not power down, the lights kept flashing, the LEDS on the control board and beaglebone were still illuminated.I waited for over 10 minutes and the ROV still had not powered down, so I unplugged and replaced the batteries. I reconnected the ROV and again encountered the same problem, cockpit would not load and ROV would not shutdown when unplugged. I replaced the batteries a second time, but when I plugged in the ROV a third time it refused to power on.I removed the electronics from the electronics tube, cleaned everything with a dry cloth and replaced them. I noticed a very small amount of condensate on electronic boards. When I plugged the ROV into my computer it again refused to turn on. I then decided to test the beaglebone alone. I tried powering it up via usb and found that it did not power up at all. All LEDs remained off.Does this sound like I need a new beaglebone? Could any of the other electronic boards be affected?Thanks in advance for any assistance."

The o-rings can leak for a few reasons:There is dirt, silt or some other small particle on the O-ring or O-ring Channel. Even the smallest dust particle can cause the seal to fail. Be sure to thoroughly clean the O-ring, as well as the channel on the end cap that it sits on, as well as the inner diameter of your acrylic tube. Be sure to use an o-ring that is free of imperfections, use a very small layer of lubrication, and make sure it slides in entirely and doesn‰Ûªt get caught on the corner of the tube. If it does, you will need to chamfer the edge some more.There could be a scratch on the tube. Even the smallest vertical scratch will create a channel for water to flow through. When this happens it usually occurs during the chamfering step of the build. If this is the case you will need to replace your e-tube.The o-ring could be sized improperly- But based on the size of the seal from the pictures you provided, it looks like your seal is the right size, I would say it is safe to rule this one out.Let me know if you need more help!

The best seal is a simple one, where everything is exceptionally clean. The mechanics of the o-ring seal work best with nothing sitting between the o-ring and its sealing surface. Under pressure, the o-ring compresses and creates a stronger seal. That is why if there is dust or a scratch on a the seal surface, then under pressure water will find its way in anyway. Please look at this diagram to see what I mean.You should have received extra o-rings with your kit, replace them if necessary. And if you have any scratches on the edge of your acrylic tube you will want to replace it, as it is never going to be fully water tight again."

Walt_Holm,"             2016-02-02 22:44:18 UTC           ","Hi mac-p-a:I would not recommend running a USB cable from your laptop to the Beaglebone.  If you do that it will attempt to power the BeagleBone through the USB +5V supply, and this will be in contention with the +5V supply on the Controller Board.  I don‰Ûªt know that it would do damage, but I would avoid it just to be safe.When you connect to the BeagleBone with an Ethernet cable, you still need to turn the ROV on.  OpenROV is powered by placing a small voltage on the tether, which the controller board senses and uses to turn on its power supplies.  So, to turn on the controller board, keep the USB cable running to the topside box, and the topside box connected to the ROV via the tether.  This should power on the controller board, which will in turn power on the BeagleBone.If you see power lights on the controller board, and you still don‰Ûªt see the controller board functioning (lasers, motors, lights, etc), then I would check the BeagleBone alignment as referred to by BrianG above.-W"

Nothing‰Ûªs going to work until you get the controller board turned on.It is possible that it is defective, though this is not likely- every controller board gets tested at the factory, and the power switch circuitry has proven to be quite reliable.  So here are some things to try:Are your batteries fully charged?  When you examine the battery contacts in the battery tubes, are they free of contamination like epoxy, glue, whatever?Make sure that you‰Ûªre not putting the batteries in backwards, and that the battery tube wiring is not backwards from what‰Ûªs in the instructions.If all that looks OK, set up your ROV with the clear main tube off but the controller board installed on the endcap.  Use a short piece of wire to jumper across the two contacts of Controller Board J12 (this is marked as Power Switch, it‰Ûªs just under the barrel connector of the BeagleBone).  Does this turn the controller board on?  If so, then there‰Ûªs probably an issue with your tether wiring.Give that all a try and let us know how it goes.-W"

However, I know I double (and triple) checked the batteries to make sure they were fully charged and properly installed.I haven‰Ûªt tried wiring the two contacts of controller board J12. I shall try it tomorrow. Say the controller board doesn‰Ûªt turn on, what would be the next step?If I understand correctly, if the controller board turns on after this test, re-doing the tether wiring would assure that the 5V coming from the computer succesfully reaches the controller board? The controller board needs the 5v current coming from the tether to turn on. Does that mean that It can only draw current from the batteries once it is turned on?I‰Ûªm a noob with electronics lol.I appreciate your helpPierre"
Walt_Holm,"             2016-02-04 19:27:54 UTC           ","Hi Pierre:If you short the contacts at J12 and the controller board doesn‰Ûªt turn on, then the next step would be to figure out if battery voltage is getting to the controller board.  You would need to get a voltmeter, and measure the voltage at the DB-25 connector J5 where the power comes in- you should find about 9.6 volts when you measure between pins 5 and 4, and when you measure between pins 6 and 7.  You can grab the schematic of the controller board on our electronics github site here.  Connector J5 is on sheet 2 of the schematic.As to your last comment, yes, the 5V on the tether throws a switch on the controller board, which then sends battery power to the processors on the controller board.  If the controller board is not correctly hooked to the tether, then it will never turn on (unless you jumper J12 as described above).Hope this helps.-Walt"

Well done!Just to make sure i have not missed anything, have you also connected the Ethernet plug to the computer?So far you description matches the usual behavior of the ROV booting. The USB plug of the top box is solely used for energy supply and the communication runs via the extra Ethernet plug towards your computer. Make sure to attach both, and follow the guide to setting up the ROV so that you can access the ROV cockpit in the browser.

The fix for me is usually to press the reset button on the topside and onboard reset buttons for 10 seconds each (first one, then quickly the other).  LED6 and the topside leftmost LEDs will start flashing green, then find each other in a few minutes.Are you getting LED6 green-solid and LED8 amber solid?  If LED6 is solid green, then you have power to the controller board Tenda.  If LED8 is green, then ethernet is detected.  In this case, definitely try resetting the Tenda buttons.If you aren‰Ûªt even getting LED6 then you have a bigger problemIf you get LED6 but not LED8, then check your ethernet connections to make sure all are in tight."

Stable Software for v2.4 ROV - OpenROV 2.4 and Below - OpenROV Forums,,
Eric_Stackpole,"             2013-11-20 22:53:41 UTC           ","Hey all-Recently several people have completed version 2.4 OpenROV kits and have been having trouble getting software to work properly on their new ROVs.  It turns out that in the process of preparing software for 2.5, we got a bit sloppy with our revisions so it's taken us a bit of time to recover a stable version of BeagleBone and Arduino code that work together.I'm happy to say that last night, we got what seems to be a stable version of software working, so I've made an image of it which will hopefully get people with built-up v2.4 OpenROVs up and running. Conveniently, this version of software will even let you program the Atmega328 on the OpenROV Cape using Cockpit, so you won't need to pull the chip off.   If you have a 2.4, please help us test this out and let us know if it works!Here's how to get the SW running on your 2.4 OpenROV---------Applying the image to your micro SD card-----------------Step 1: Download OpenROV_2_4_Stable.zipStep 2: (For windows) Download SDFormatter and Win32DiskImager to your computerStep 3: Format a microSD card using SDFormatter.  ""Quick Format"" will work fineStep 4: Unzip OpenROV_2_4_StableStep 5: Run Win32DiskImager and select the image file (ending in *.img) you just unzipped.  Make sure that the drive you select under ""Device"" is the SD card you've inserted.Step 6: Write the image file to your formatted SD card by pressing the ""Write"" button in Win32DiskImager.  This process will take around 5 or 10 minuets.Step 7: Once the image has been successfully applied to the microSD card, eject the card and put in in your BeagleBone.----------------------------Connecting to the ROV--------------------------Step 8: Turn your ROV on and allow about 60 seconds for it to boot.Step 9: Make sure your computer's LAN port is set to a static IP address that looks like ""192.168.254.x"" where ""x"" is any value less then 254 and not 1Step 10: Plug your ROV into your computer, open Google Chrome, and go to the following address: 192.168.254.1:8080Step 11: OpenROV Cockpit should come up after several seconds (it may take a moment for the video to appear).  Because the Cape has not yet been programmed you will not be able to control the lights or motors, and you won't see any valid telemetry.------------------------Programming the OpenROV Cape---------------Step 12: In Cockpit, press the ""Settings"" button in the upper right-hand side of the screen, and press ""Upload""  (you don't need to select anything under ""choose file"").Step 13: A window called ""Upload Arduino Firmware"" will pop up.  Press the blue ""Apply New Firmware"" button in the lower right side of the window.  This will upload the Arduino Code necessary for the Cape to work.Step 14: Once the Arduino Firmware has been uploaded (the window will stay open, but the green progress bar will have made it all the way to the right) you can close the window.  Step 15: Restart the ROVStep 16: Once the ROV has restarted, verify that you can read telemetry data, control the lights, and control the thrusters.  You may need to program and calibrate the thrusters before they respond properly to commands.Step 17:  Let us know how it works out!-E"

Cockpit displayed voltage is 12.4v, displayed current is .835A with no LEDs or motors on.  Cockpit keeps changing the time, voltage, current and CPU usage when a frame is frozen.  The CPU usage may drop to as low as 4% during a frozen frame.  The current also will drop a little.  Most of the time if I move my hand the frame will unstick and start running at ~3 fps and exposure will look good.   If I move my hand in the same area where it froze it will freeze and unfreeze until the lighting changes enough.With the room lights off and the LEDs set to 10% the video does not appear freeze and it runs at ~3fps.  If I turn the LEDs up to 100% I can get it to freeze some times by waving my hand close to the camera (6 inches).Using the HP Pavilion Elite HPE the video in normal room light appears to run at ~5 fps and will have some freeze frames when lighting is just right.  I move my hand in front of the camera (6-10 inches and backlit) to get freeze frames.  I think it freezes just under the right lighting conditions.

If I turn the LEDs up to 100% I can get it to freeze some times by waving my hand close to the camera (8 inches).I think the video freezes are caused by light level differences.I have tested the camera on the 2 computers plugging it directly into to the USB port and the camera work properly.I did not have video freeze when using an older image (I think it was from around 5/2013)..  But when running this older image the video from time to time would turn to a small black rectangle in the upper left corner of the video window and I would have to refresh the cockpit from the browser to get the video back.Also now when I use my game pad the two rear thrust motors will not stop when the joy stick is in the center position. I have to move it slightly to the right to stop the motors.  The vertical thruster does not run when its joy stick is centered and the joy stick works correctly.  I have calibrated the game pad many times but the rear thrust motors still run when the joy stick is centered.  This did not happen with the older image.Computer used for the tests:Toshiba Qosmio Lap Top with Intel Pentium M processer 1.86GHz with 1.0 GB of RAMrunning Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition Version 2002, Service Pack 3HP Pavilion Elite HPE model HPE-447c, AMD Phenom II X6 1045T processer, 2.700GHz 6 Cores, 8.00GBof RAM running Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium Version 6.1.7601, Service Pack 1 Build 7601I need help.

Adam_Christensen,"             2015-07-31 09:50:02 UTC           ","A couple of points that may help your debugging; The flashing of the light board will occur when the cockpit is running but there is no communications with the surface, if these are flashing for a period and then stopping it sounds like the beaglebone is booting up, successfully loading the cockpit and then rebooting after a period.  The same with the servo buzzing, the buzzing is when the servo can‰Ûªt hold the correct position, again if it is stopping and starting I suspect that the beaglebone is resetting.I would start by making sure the batteries are fully charged and that there are no poor connections (either on the D25 connector or the way the batteries/terminals are mating).  Do you have an IMU installed? If so double check the wiring as faults here have caused people a range of headaches.  If you cant find anything wrong here, removing everything bar the tether and battery connections from the D25 connector and re-test."

Yesterday we got back to work on the OpenROV and found that the Tenda board mounted underneath the beaglebone was causing a short. Only part of the board is protected by a plastic shield. We covered the rest with electrical tape and were finally able to make the connection to the cockpit. After wrapping up the remaining build steps it went in the pool for a successful maiden voyage.

The metal screws that went between the light board and the camera was causing the ground planes to connect, resulting in the lights always being on.We have made a note for the next round of light boards to increase the screw mounting area to avoid contact.The issue with plastic screws is being able to source M2 screws that are the length we need.We have also made a note in the directions to avoid people having the same problems in the future.Thank you again. It is great to see the community come together to find a problem, diagnose it, and solve it."

badevguru,"             2015-09-26 17:30:12 UTC           ","Thanks for the report.  So there is a log file that has a lot of ‰ÛÏstuff‰Ûù in it.  That does include the list of commands sent to the ROV, but not timestamps.If however, you turn on the data logging, r key, then it will record the data with timestamps to a file that can be exported.When you say you are using the latest software, is that 30.0.2 that was released last month?All of the recent firmware has a deadman switch that automatically disables the motors if connectivity to the browser gets lost for more than 3 seconds, which limits the cases where the motors could keep pushing forward.There are only three ways I can conceive that the motors would keep going if you tried to stop.The command never got sent to the ROV.  If the browser window is not the ‰ÛÏfocused‰Ûù window on the computer, it goes not capture the keyboard or gamepad inputs.  There are also some combinations of browser and o/s where the you have to fully release a key before pressing another for the system to register the keyboard input.  This can be seen by checking the telemetry from the ‰ÛÏcmd‰Ûù line. It shows the last command received by the Arduino.  If you see a thro(0) then you know the stop command was received by the Arduino.  It can be hard to see this because the telemetry is only updating once a second and other commands like ping(0) can happen between the throttle command and when the telemetry updates.The Arduino died.  That would prevent it from sending the stop command to the motors.  This could happen if batteries are low.  The command comes in, the motors start which draw down the voltage with weak batteries, that causes the Arduino to shutdown.  At some point, possibly the reduced resistance of pulling the motors in to the air, causes the voltage to come up high enough that the  Arduino kicks back in and resets the motors.  This is easier to check because the runtime on the cockpit will freeze and then reset to zero.The commands that are being sent to the ROV are getting queued up somewhere.  We have seen some weird cases where the commands do get queued.  I think this is an issue that is limited to the 30.0.2 release and co-insides with a situation where the ROV will seem responsive, you still get latency graph for the connection, the the connection lights turns red and telemetry stops updating.Hope this helps give some things to look for if it happens again.-Brian"

When you connect the topside box, all that is doing is sending a signal to the ROV to turn the power on. This keeps your robot from draining the batteries when not in use. Typically, you‰Ûªll want to keep your battery voltage level above 6.5-7V or so (can‰Ûªt remember the exact level). Also, you want to make sure that all of your batteries are charged to roughly the same level (within a tenth or so of a volt), so you should never have one battery at 3.0V while the rest are at 3.3V."

Although the new IMU is wired up, I have left it unpotted at this stage, to test it before committing to epoxy.The cockpit displays normally, but I‰Ûªm receiving no heading or attitude information.  The HUD shows a level attitude, and does not move when I move the ROV.  The heading tape shows North, and does not move at all.A possible cause (although I‰Ûªm guessing here) is that my software version is reported differently in two locations.  Hovering the cursor over the COCKPIT logo inside the ROV cockpit (192.168.254.1:8080), it says that I‰Ûªm running 30.0.0.  On the DASHBOARD (192.168.254.1) under the SOFTWARE tab however, it says I‰Ûªm running 30.0.2 and that my ROV is up to date.Any ideas, anyone?My ROV is operational with the exception of the IMU data.

badevguru,"             2015-08-06 21:54:43 UTC           ","The primary issue is to isolate the problem. Basically, if the IMU runs on a dedicated Arduino without fail that is a good data point.  If then the IMU runs with our existing software and controller board with its own dedicated power to the IMU, that would be a good data point.  Knowing if the IMU continues to respond to an I2C bus scan even when not responding correctly to the device ID check would also be a good data point.Some ideas in troubleshooting it:If you have an Arduino handy, you can easily adapt the code we have on board for the BNO055 to work alone.  You basically cut and paste the cpp file code in to a new sketch and rename the device_setup and device_loop to setup and loop.  Just a few other lines to cleanup and it should work.  There are also some libraries on github for the BNO055 you can grab.2a. Assume that there is something regarding the power to the device.  We know the 2.7 board has limited headroom on the 5V regulator it is using.  Could the board be drawing more power than the 2.7 board can handle?  If you have a bench supply, go ahead and power the IMU with dedicate 5V power, link the ground between the power supply the the ground off of the ROV, and see if the issue goes away.2b. Alternately, the BNO055 has low power mode options that are currently disabled, review the spec sheet and try initializing it in low power mode to see if that helps.I‰Ûªll keep thinking about it, but I don‰Ûªt have much else to go on without a failing device in hand."

When the Bosch does respond, the code first runs the sensor through it‰Ûªs self test, which typically takes about 4 seconds.For the system‰Ûªs that are getting a third beep, I suspect that the Bosch sensor is not immediately available after the 2nd beep (which is an intentional arduino reset).  So the system waits 30 seconds and then tries to initialize it.  As it does so‰Û_ for some reason I cannot yet explain, it is possible the self test code takes more than 8 seconds which triggers a hardware reset of the Arduino‰Û_ the 3rd beep.One thing you can try, and I would like to know how it goes, it disabling the ‰ÛÏ2nd beep‰Ûù, which is the intentionally Arduino reset.  That line of code can be found here: https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-cockpit/blob/master/etc/rc.local#L36To disable it you have to ssh in to the rov.  The you can usesudo pico /opt/openrov/cockpit/etc/rc.local and then you can put a Hash tag in front of the line that says /opt/openrov/cockpit/linux/reset.sh to disable that line. Then press control-x to exit and save.Reboot, and the system should only have the single beep on initial power up.  My hope is that the Bosch sensor is stable on initial power and just works‰Û_ and that something about how we are reseting the system might be causing an issue.  Just speculation at this point."

badevguru,"             2015-08-26 21:57:53 UTC           ","Update:So @spiderkeys has been kicking butt characterizing the issue with the IMU.  We have been able to successfully recreate the issues that folks have seen.  If you have a 2.8 controller board, you should be fine.  For earlier controller boards, we have updated Arduino firmware code that we are putting out in a new beta release sometime this week.Going deeper‰Û_Ultimately, when we were cycling the Arduino, we had situations where the I2C conversation with the sensor can be left incomplete.  The sensor in this case is very intolerant of that and does not recover gracefully.  Those 2nd and 3rd beeps of the ROV startup sequence are restarts of the Arduino.  Given the frequency of the communication with the IMU sensor, the Arduino reset almost guarantees hanging the sensor.  Those restarts have been isolated and removed from the system.Totally geeky temporary work around to prove to yourself that your IMU works:  If you have a 2.7 controller board or earlier model with the IMU2 there is a hack to see it working while you wait for our software fix.  This hack is only good for those with the ROV running on your desk.  You can wait for the entire system to boot up, remove the power from the IMU, wait a second, and then reapply the power to the IMU and it will respond.Thanks for your patients.

It may be worth checking the individual battery voltages as its possible that this could happen as a result of dodgy cells.Beyond that, from your description it sounds the controller board is booting up fine (the blinking lights are indicating that it is not receiveing anything from the cockpit, and I suspect the noise you are hearing is the camera servo trying to hold position. both normal).  It also sounds like the beaglebone is getting power (you noted in your first post that the ethernet lights and blue leds are blinking) but failing to boot (no cylon pattern), and that the image on the beaglebone is fine.  My suggestion would be to eliminate as much as possible from the equation, disconnect the camera, switch of all the ESCs and see how you go.  If it still wont boot consider desoldering any connections other than the battery and tether connections on the D25 connector, if you still get nothing you are basically down to a hardware fault on the controller board."

Warning, part of my slow response is dealing with a service we were using for the web updates being down.  As a result, you may have to stop the openrov-proxy and connect your ROV directly to the internet to perform any of these actions.Ultimately, you want to install the Openrov-rov-suite package. It will take care of updating the rest of the packages that are grouped with that suite.apt-get install openrov-rov-suite=30.0.0~99.06d0548Now I am saying this from memory.  apt-get typically prevents you from being able to ‰ÛÏdowngrade‰Ûù versions of the applications.  Since you ended up upgrading to pre-release versions (and I apologize that we shipped something that even made that possible), you may have to first uninstall all of the openrov packages first.you can use dpkg --list | grep openrov to list all of the packages.Of course the easiest way to fix this is to simply download the flash-image and return the image to the beaglebone. http://www.openrov.com/products/2-8.html"

From the beginning we always had two issues with the electronic housing and the battery tubes. First, that the silicon lube we used was a bit to slippery so that we needed to MacGyver around to make sure the electronic housing didn‰Ûªt open itself. Second, that the sharp edges of the notches for the battery tube o-rings cutted two o-rings already.Understandibly I was quite jealous about the nice black straps that were added to the new version. So I started to look for a similar solution for our 2.6 model. It was in fact very easy to accomplish, therefore I wanted to share it for others with similar issues.I think the pictures speak for themselves. What we did is just, make three straps in the correct length, add the buckles and file 4 notches in the end caps of the electronic tube. The hard thing was actually to find these tiny buckles and I found only one online shop for Germany that had all what we needed.IMG_20150521_125002.jpg3264x2448 2.03 MB The buckle for the electronic tube is on the bottom to keep it out of the way.IMG_20150521_125035.jpg2448x3264 1.22 MB Two small notches per end cap ensure that the strap is not sliding off.IMG_20150521_125249.jpg3264x2448 1.34 MB The strap additionally prevents the o-rings from sliding in between tube and cap.IMG_20150521_124955.jpg3264x2448 1.93 MB Same here, buckles to the bottom. The battery straps are secured with zip ties to prevent sliding off.IMG_20150521_124948.jpg3264x2448 1.7 MBFor the batteries, the straps are nicely held by the original o-ring notches.IMG_20150521_125302.jpg3264x2448 1.78 MB I think it looks happy!"

Check out this other forum post and check to make sure that this is not leading to the issue.Laser Cutting Imperfection Leading to Water Leaking Open Talk    After some analysis of our manufacturing technique for making the main electronics tube endcaps, we have found a flaw that affects some of the o-ring grooves. The 6mm piece of cut acrylic that the o-ring is initially pressed against might have an imperfection at the point where the laser cut starts and stops. The o-ring can compensate for this imperfection in most cases, but if the amount of o-ring doesn't fit snug enough inside the electronics tube there can be a leak. If you have having proble‰Û_  Second, the way the vacuum test is being conducted it is possible to have a small drop in pressure even if there is no drop in pressure in the tube. If the outside 1.5mm white acrylic piece and the larger 6mm clear piece do not have a cementing job that covers the entire surface, air can travel between these layers and thus have the decrease in pressure.Plunger (1).png800x600 30 KBFrom an operational standpoint there is no issue if this is the cause of the decrease in pressure.The test of the electronics is a very good way to see if water is getting into the tube.One last comment would be that when you open and close the tube water can sit on the inside of the tube and it can appear that there is a drop of water on the inside but it is left over from opening the tube."
w0hgr,"             2015-08-26 12:59:34 UTC           ","Thank you so much for all your help. Since I actually found water drops inside the main tube beforeopening it, I was certain that I have a small leak. I found that the cable feed through is the problembecause I wrapped some soft paper around the cables to absorb any possible water and thensubmerged it with a 15 mmHg vacuum making sure the cable feed through is on the top and wouldnot absorb any water from any other possible leaks. After about 15 minutes I checked it and  nowI had no water drops inside, but the paper was completely wet. I know I  sealed the cable very welleven using a small pinpoint heatgun to heat the epoxy giving it a better flow and to eliminate anypossible air pockets and moving the wires around while potting it and then heating it.How can I fixthis leak? I thought about cutting a part of a larger syringe and building a 3/4"" tall collar around thecables and the filling it with epoxy. Is this a workable solution or can you make any other recommendations."

Adam_Christensen,"             2015-08-19 15:28:10 UTC           ","I been meaning to look into his myself, from what I understand the range of movement of the camera servo has been limited to protect the servo from moving anywhere near the mechanical limit of the camera mount, this also provide additional tolerance during assembly (if the servo zero position is not accurately in the middle of the range.The available range appears to be limited in two locations, firstly in mapping the control inputs to the servo pulse period in;\opt\openrov\cockpit\src\lib\ArduinoPhysics.js : in the following section:physics.mapTiltServo = function (value) {value = limit(value, -0.7, 0.7);return mapA(value, -1, 1, 1000, 2000);};The second limitation is in the arduino code, located in;\opt\openrov\arduino\OpenROV\CameraMount.cpp : in the section:void CameraMount::device_loop(Command command){if (command.cmp(‰ÛÏtilt‰Ûù)) {if ((command.args[1] > 999) && (command.args[1] < 2001)){tilt_val = command.args[1];cameraMountdata::CMTG = tilt_val;}}The HS-81 has a full range of 180 degrees (600us - 2400us) which works out as 1 degree per 10us (with 1500us being the zero position), mapTiltServo limits this to 1500us +/- 350us (or +/- 35 degrees).  If your zero position is faily close any you have free movement of the camera mount over the full range it should be pretty safe to increase the limits in mapTiltServo from (-0.7,0.7) to (-1,1) which should give you another 15 degrees of travel in each direction (three additional steps in each way).If you wanted to go more than this, I would carefully measure the maximal travel of the camera mount in each direction from the zero position and take the smaller of the two, subtract a safety margin (say 10 degrees)and use this to calculate the max/min pulse period to be used in both locations (as well as changing the limits above).  Note: you will need to re-compile/upload the changes to the ardiuno for this to take effect.Just to re-iterate, I have not tried any of this (yet) and mistakes will likely end up stripping the gears in the servo.  Care would also need to be taken if you remove/adjust the servo at any point in the future as a small misalignment of the horn could result in the same."

Also could you check the number of steps you are getting in each direction?Steve, you can edit the source code for the arduino (controller board) that is stored on the beaglebone, but this still needs to be compiled and sent to the ardiuno (really it is just a process of uploading, as the code is automatically compiled from the source code that exists on the beaglebone).This can be done via ssh by running:sudo /etc/init.d/openrov stopsudo /opt/openrov/cockpit/linux/arduino/firmware-installfromsource.shI agree it would be handy to have a guide that includes some of the more common software modifications, but given the target audience would be those not familiar with linux and/or coding in general this may not be a trivial exercise.

My fps seems to be very low - like 1 - 4 frames per second. What sort of troubleshooting can I do to track down the issue?Here are some data on my situation‰Û_Rover version 2.5 Software version 30.0.2 , though hovering over ‰ÛÏCockpit‰Ûù onscreen shows 30.0.0~163.0dec0baPinging the rover gives me 100% return, something like 4msAll three lights on the topside adapter are on, middle one flashes at maybe .25 secondsBBB LEDs show proper cylon-like back and forth progressionconfig.js updated through putty, to  set video_resolution: process.env.VIDEO_RESOLUTION || ‰Û÷SVGA‰Ûª,     followed by pushing the software to the arduino again and then rebooting the ROV. This increased the video life but still freezes. I confirmed that the update was saved by SSHing in after reboot and examining config.jsSometimes video does not come up at all on rebooting ROV.ROV Lights often flash while it is onCockpit shows green connection light, about 9.6V power, right after full recharge of batteriesAbout .5A being drawnMotors work and lights/lasers obey keyboard commandsClicking Depth Zero doesn‰Ûªt help (My IMU is not yet working anyway)Stopping/restarting the cockpit software doesn‰Ûªt work to fix video - instead cockpit reappears with no video (black) and full HUD.Video often freezes with a partial overexposed frame visible.Same issues using three different laptops, with Chrome and Firefoxstarting up the rover or restarting cockpit from the dashboard IN THE DARK seems to fix the freezing. But turning on the ROV lights and moving my hand in front of it will make it freeze again, as will turning on the room lights."

Towel them off and put them somewhere safe to dry. Don‰Ûªt heat them up though.Same with electronics, after removing from power (which happens when you unplug from the endcap) though there are more steps you can follow involving rice (or other) to draw moisture away (though I am not familiar with them). If salt water only touches the e-chassis but not the electronics, you probably should rinse it all down any way.

I got the first beeps, but not the second - and no feed from the ROV. After a couple of minutes I get flashing main LEDs on the ROV. I noticed then that the middle orange light on the topside adapter was out and pressed the reset button. After that I get all 3 solid lights but still the same result. The first beeps only and after a few minutes flashing LEDs on the ROV.

The only way the thrusters will respond to the arrow keys is when I open the diagnostics panel and set both port and starboard thruster to -1. When pressing the up arrow after this, both port and starboard rotates clockwise and the only way they will stop is by holding the down arrow key or by first pressing 0 or 1 followed by -1 again in the diagnostics panel. There is no way I can make them rotate counter-clockwise.The problem is similar with the vertical thruster, it will only rotate counter-clockwise when set to 1 in the diagnostics panel and does not stop.I have tried downloading the latest image to the BBB. I also tried opening and closing the diagnostics panel as described here: OpenROV-ROV-Suite 2.5.1 Final Errants.It is also worth mentioning that although the 2.7 unit should be shipped with all software pre-installed, this was not the case with mine. I had to manually download the software to the BBB.Is this a software issue or are the ESCs malfunctioning in some way. Are they perhaps not pre-programmed and/or pre-calibrated as they should be?"

After that, with a little bit of force you should be able to pop out the bearings to replace them. You will find a bearing in the top of the motor wiring and in the bottom.

I suspected that it was the Black Beagle Bone board that was causing the problem. So, I programmed the Black Beagle Bone board with the software build that I found in (http://www.openrov.com/products/2-7.html). I programmed the software successfully to the Beagle Bone board. I managed to get to the cockpit through the web browser with the software build that I programmed in to the eMMC flash on the Black Beagle Bone flash. When I reattached the Black Beagle Bone board to the Arduino Controller board and power up my ROV, I didn‰Ûªt see the Black Beagle Bone board boot up at all. I didn‰Ûªt see blue LED on the Black Beagle Bone board  lit up even after I waited over a few minutes. Could it be that the Arduino Controller board is not compatible with the software build from http://www.openrov.com/products/2-7.html. If so, how can I update the Arduino Controller board. My Black Beagle Bone board is not booting up while attached to the Arduino Controller board. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks."

Before I flashed my Black Beagle Bone Board with the OpenROV-flash-2.5.1-39.img, I was able to see the blue LEDs on the Blue Beagle Bone board and the lasers lit up as soon as I plug in the USB cable from my computer to the topside electronics box. After I did the flash to the Black Beagle Bone board, I saw the blue LEDs on my Beagle Bone Board lit up for a couple seconds and never came back on, and the laser light never lit up. Everything was connected the same way as before. The only light that stayed on was the LED1 on the Arduino micro controller. I could hear a humming sound from the servo when I put my ear close to the robot. So, the only delta here is the image on the Black Beagle Bone flash.At this point, I haven‰Ûªt received my battery chargers yet. So, it is very likely that my batteries are out of juice.

I finally got everything working, but not without going through some more headaches. It turns out that my connection issue to the ROV cockpit via the Chrome web browser was caused by several things:I have VMWare installed in my computer. The VMWare software assigned an IP address of 192.168.254.1 to one of its virtual network card. So, when I attempted to connect to the web browser via 192.168.254.1, it was trying to communicate with the virtual network card rather than with the Black Beagle Bone. To resolve this matter, disable the virtual network card or assign a different IP address to the virtual network card.I have several sets of Powerline Ethernet Adapter already running in my house, before I got this ROV v2.7 kit. I learned that having several sets of Powerline Ethernet Adapter somehow caused confusion to the Tenda P200 Adapter in the ROV. So, when I try to ping it from the command prompt, it will say ‰ÛÏdestination unreachable‰Ûù.

I used a 3D printer to create the clampsI've attached the STL files and a few images to illustrate.Along with printing the parts from the STL files you'll need;(4) All thread rods measuring 10.75"" long. 10-24 SAE or 5mm .8 to stay consistent with whats on the ROV.(8) Matching nuts.(4) Washers.(4) Wing nuts matching all-thread rod.(8-12) M5-.8 nuts (8 nuts are required but depending on thickness you may need up to 12(16) pieces of aquarium tubing or heat shrink to fit over threaded rod. each piece approx .25"" long.I suggest installing the clamps to the front of the tubes first. Once positioned, glue the clamps to the battery tubes with CA. It's possible to make a one piece clamp that would not require glue but which may distort the tube when tightened.

Your modification looks pretty solid, and major points for posting all the info so others can replicate what you did.  Thanks for that!Another idea I've been working with is a sort of latch mechanism which would allow very tight cinching through mechanical advantage and would also confine any extra strap material.  I've attached a diagram below (drawn in my favorite, MSPaint, of course!) which depicts how it works. 15-OpenROVStrapLatchMechanism.png831x700 11.7 KBBasically, the mechanism is constructed out of a flat, rigid, rectangular part that has a hook on one end (A), a permanent attachment point for one end of the strap in the center (B) and a cinching attachment point (C) on the other end of the strap.  When the mechanism is in ""loose"" mode, the two ends of the strap are able to pull so that the part between points (B) and (C) would be in tension if the strap were loaded. The length between (B) and (C) is what gives the strap its slack in this mode.  When the mechanism is to be put in ""tight"" mode, end (A) is folded over the rest of the mechanism and the hook there is latched around the strap going in to end (C) to keep the mechanism in that position. The excess strap coming out of point (C) will now be confined between itself and the mechanism.  With the strap adjusted properly (at attachment point (C)), the lever action of (A) folding over will cause the points between (B) and (C) to be in compression equal to the loading on the strap.I've asked a local machine and die cutting shop how much the tooling would cost to make a bunch of these out of aluminium or stainless steel, and their quote was close to $10,000. (eeps!)  It would be cool if the parts could just be laser cut, but I fear that acrylic would be too brittle and polypropylene would be too flexible.I'd love to hear other ideas for holding endcaps closed as well.

jaredarchey,"             2015-03-31 17:35:24 UTC           ","Hello, I am trying to write code which takes input from various distance sensors mounted on the outside of the openRoV and uses the data to adjust the thrust in the motors to keep a constant distance from an object.The first question I had was which sensors would be good to measure distance underwater as accurately as possible. I have tried using waterproof car backup sensors, however when used underwater they only read the minimum distance allowed on the sensor. I would like to try some type of laser distance sensing but I know IR is only going to be good for short distances and I‰Ûªd like a range of at least 1-2.5m. So far the best thought I had was some type of sonar, so I was wondering what types of sensors would be good for thisAdditionally, once I have the sensors I was wondering if I could connect them to the free I/O pins on the arduino, and once connected where do I look to control these sensors. I‰Ûªd like to know which modules are used and which parts of the modules to change to use extra sensorsFinally, I was wondering which modules would I need to edit to add a control algorithm with these sensors and the thrusters without affecting the code already on the openROVAlso, if anyone knows where I can look for some type of document which describes each module and its function that would be amazing"
badevguru,"             2015-03-31 18:29:15 UTC           "," jaredarchey:, once I have the sensors I was wondering if I could connect them to the free I/O pins on the arduino, and once connected where do I look to control these sensors.There are several extension points for adding sensors.  The primary means if by using the I2c bus which extends outside the e-chassis.  That is what the IMU uses.  The Arduino currently serves as Master on the I2c bus.  That said, the beaglebone also has I2c capabilities and can be wired up to interface with sensors directly as well.  The other option is to use the space external wires and connect them to either the SPI pins or A/D pins.We lead with interfacing the sensors with the Arduino as it tends to have a rich community of existing driver code for interfacing with devices. jaredarchey:I‰Ûªd like to know which modules are used and which parts of the modules to change to use extra sensorsFinally, I was wondering which modules would I need to edit to add a control algorithm with these sensors and the thrusters without affecting the code already on the openROVThe Arduino code has been broken out to seperate ‰ÛÏplugin‰Ûù modules.  You can start by cloning on of those modules.  The version of Cockpit currently in master on github has been extended to make the plugins self registering and you can see what it takes to add a module by looking at this pull request for external lights. You can see what the existing modules are by taking a look at this:https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software-arduino/blob/master/OpenROV/README.md"

Similar to the problem present in this post (http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=52846&p=405486). Thus, I have download the last system available in the site (https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software/releases/tag/v2.5.0) and rebuilt. However, the system present in the iso (OpenROV-2.5-29.img.7z) that I have download is different than the system that I had.So, I remember the system that comes with the BBB (from OpenROV) is a Debian (7.6?), and now I have Ubuntu (13.10). Where can I find the last version of the OpenROV system? I have noted that the cockpit is different in this Ubuntu`s version, where the controller of depth and heading are not present.Is the version in http://54.187.8.25:8080/job/OpenROV-Image_BuildImage_master/ the last one?

kyledavis905,"             2015-03-23 19:19:26 UTC           ","Hey, recently we have purchased the open rov board without ESC‰Ûªs for a project for our school; set everything up correctly from what we have read online. But cannot reflash the firmware to the beagle bone and the open rov board using a micro sd. It keeps saying that the Arduino programmer is not responding attempt 1 out of 10 etc, 2 out of 10, etc. Then it resets the programmer and tries again. Continues this until it resets 3-5 times and then exits the programmer, and moves on to the next files to load. Heres the log that we received from the settings window after connecting and downloading the firmware.log outputundefinedSearching for Arduino lib version file (version.txt) ‰Û_ /usr/share/arduino/lib/version.txtDetecting Arduino software version ‰Û_  1.0.5 (1.0.5)Scanning dependencies of srcScanning dependencies of arduinoScanning dependencies of EEPROMScanning dependencies of SPImake: Warning: File /usr/share/arduino/libraries/Wire/utility/twi.c' has modification time 2.5e+06 s in the future Scanning dependencies of Wire make: warning: Clock skew detected.

In this case, I just confirmed with the production guys that when ordering the boards without ESCs, they are shipped with a fresh atmega2560 that has not been initialized.  You have to run the following commands from the beaglebone before you can interact with the Atmega microprocessor.sudo avrdude -P /dev/spidev1.0 -b 10000 -c linuxspi -vv -p m2560 -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U hfuse:w:0xDE:m -U efuse:w:0xFD:m -U lock:w:0x3F:msudo avrdude -P /dev/spidev1.0 -c linuxspi -vv -p m2560 -U flash:w:/usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/bootloaders/stk500v2/stk500boot_v2_mega2560.hex -U lock:w:0x0f:mAfter running those commands you can then load the firmware.edit: changed baud rate from 1000 to 10000 to correct initial post"

[solved] Electronics: Controller not powering BBB or Comm board - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,
Jeremy,"             2014-10-03 15:31:23 UTC           ","Hi OpenROVers,New to the website.  I am having some wiring issues with my OpenROV 2.6.  I have observed a constellation of symptoms that hopefully makes the issue specific.  Would greatly appreciate any help on this, it is my first solo electronics project.I check the voltages on the 25-pin connector, all perfect (12 V for both power supplies, 5 V on the tether).  These are always perfect.My ESCs receive voltage (12V) on their 2 electrodes, I can tell by testing the backside of the board.  However, they display a constant red LED and do not respond to holding down the ""set"" button.I get good voltages at several points on the controller board (D11, J12, J17) but get no voltage for the checkpoints at the center of the controller board (where the comm board connects).  In J6, where the BBB connects, I get 0.8V between pins 1 and 3, and nothing else.I can power on the BBB and view the webcam when I plug the topside adapter's powercord into the BBB (powering it directly) so I don't think it is a BBB issue.While none of the 25-pins seem to short when I test with multimeter, I do see that the motor A/B/C pins all seem to be connected (shorted?).  Is this normal?  It seems like they all touch each other within the bell of the motor and it would be very hard to prevent that with the shrink tubing.Lastly, I noticed that sometimes when I power up, or toggle an ESC on/off switch, or accidentally touch two parts of the board with a multimeter probe, the ESC lights shut off and 25-pin voltage, when measured from the pin nubs on the back of the controllerboard, sinks from 12V to 2V.  If I unplug the 25-pin and test it directly, it is 12 V, but plugging it in causes a sink to 2V.  The 2V measurement on the back of the board persists even while the 25-pin plug is unplugged (capacitors discharging slowly)?  Usually if I wait awhile, I can re-plug the 25-pin and go back to normal 12V and solid red ESC lights.  Maybe an intermittent short?So to recap the observable symptoms:1)  Solid red ESCs unresponsive to set button2)  Normal voltages around perimeter of board3)  But no voltage for Comm board pins4)  And only 0.8V for BBB pins (between 1 and 3)5)  Motor A/B/Cs seem to be shorted within the motorsI have seen prior posts indicating this can be a polarity issue, I have tried switching the polarity to no avail and have measured many times.I have also seen that connecting J17 to J18 can force power to the BBB.  I do not have a J18 on this board.Thanks very much for any help!"
Walt_Holm,"             2014-10-05 18:36:32 UTC           ","Hi Jeremy:   The controller board doesn't power up until it has received a voltage across the tether.  You say that there's 5V measured on the tether, so it should be powering up.  Do any of the LEDs on the controller board light up?  If there is ~12V on the battery terminals and 5V on the tether, then the +5V switching supply should fire up and the PWR LED (green LED1) should be lit.  Shorting the pins of J12 together should also get the board to turn on.   I don't understand why you would have 12V on the ESCs if it appears that the rest of the board is off.  The ESCs do not have power routed to them until the on-board Arduino boots.  The pins of J17 can be shorted to force the ESCs to be powered-up all the time.   I would recommend downloading the schematic for the 2.6 controller board from our Github site (in the openrov-electronics category) to help you with debugging.   Other odds and ends:   The BBB is powered by 5V, not 3.3.  If you want to measure the power it's getting, that is between pins 1 and 5.  The 0.8V you're seeing sounds like leakage current through the battery-current measurement circuitry, when the board is not powered on.   J18 is one of the connections for the homeplug adapter.   The coil resistance of the motors is only around an ohm or so.  That might be why it looks like you have a short.  If you are concerned that you actually have a short, take a very careful measurement of the coil resistance and see if it is consistent from motor to motor.   Let us know how things progress.-W"

I think my frequent handling may have caused an issue. Now I get proper 12V voltages at the 21-pin junction (as measured from the reverse of the controller board (so I know that power is going to the board), but 0 voltages everywhere else.I cannot find an intermediate measurement point between the 12V's and the 0V's to diagnose further.  Even the ESCs now show 0 voltage (note, I have removed 2 since they kept coming loose from my handling, and now only one ESC is attached to the board).Considering buying a new controller board as the issue seems to be taking place within the board (i.e. between the terminals I can measure).Any thoughts or advice greatly appreciated."

I can't see the connections on the photo you attached to verify that.Then I'd download the schematic of the 2.6 controller board from our GitHub site, and trace the tether voltage as it winds its way to optocoupler OC1 (shown on sheet 3 of the schematic).  When you short the pins at J12, you are just bypassing Optocoupler OC1.The ESCs are normally turned on by the software running on the Arduino processor.  Since you haven't loaded any software on it yet, it won't turn on the ESCs.  Thus you have to jumper J17 to turn them on.-W"

On the topside adapter, I get a green power LED and an orange Ethernet Connect LED and a blank Homeplug connect.  On topside, I get 5V over J3, 0V over J5, and 3V over J4.  On the controller board, I get 4.9V between Tether A and Tether B pins (measured beneath the board) On the controller board, I get 4.8V over J19, 4.8V over J10, and 3.2V over J18The cockpit is blank (no connection) when I try to load it through the topside box/controllerboard/bbbI think the main cause of my troubles has been that I lacked the dexterity to solder my 25 pin DB, caused a short, and fried my first BBB and possible the controller board (had to solder over J12 to power the board, OC1 probably dead). So there could be damage from that.Also, J7 has no voltage across it on the controller board, even when I connect J17 (which gives me voltage over the ESCs)As always, much appreciated for following the saga; if you asked, I would happily pay for tech support.  For my part, I'm learning more from troubleshooting than I would if it had all just worked out of box.187-cockpit.PNG (1.49 MB)188-1.jpg (74.4 KB)189-2.jpg (62.3 KB)      "

Using the controls, I was able to spin the propeller on command as well as raise and lower the camera.  I was drawing 0.4AHowever, then a weird short appeared.  I am using a power supply (instead of a battery, to guard against shorts).  I added the other two ESCs, turned it on and had a short (which causes the power supply to flick the power on and off as it hits and then drops current limit).  Shutting off power and turning it back on did not resolve the short, only shutting off/removing onboard Tenda/replacing onboard Tenda, caused the short to resolve.  It then started shorting after booting up, which made me suspect that attempting to power the ESCs was the problem.It seems now that when I have the ESCs in and have at least one ESC switch on, the short occurs.  If I leave all ESCs off, I can view the webcam and control the lights, but I can no longer move the camera.  Obviously with the ESC‰Ûªs switched off, I can also not spin the propellers.  Any of the 3 ESCs cause this short.Ligating over J17 does not have any effect; there is a voltage of 12V over it though.When I try to control the motors in any way (up down left right ctrl or shift), BTX illuminates so the signal is getting to the controller board.I have tried all of the various toggle buttons (like [ to enable ESCs)There is 12V over the ESC itself (Power and GND) and 0 V over J7 even when I try to move the propellersThe behavior is not 100% consistent.  Occassionally, I will have the system set up as described and try an ESC switch (short), try again (short), try again and get a quick burst that moves the webcam servo followed by no short.  The cockpit must then reboot because of the intial short (and generally won‰Ûªt, despite all indicator lights on control board and Tenda lit), but I then get 6V over J7; still cannot use red button to program the ESC.  Drawing 0.5A.  Restarting power brings back the short.I don‰Ûªt see how this could be a soldering issue on the control board, all connections look good."

My power supply can only deliver 1A.I had discarded this theory because, even with all of the ESCs switched off, I could not recover the ability to move the webcam.  Similarly, I could not boot up with only one ESC on and control the propeller.However, I failed to account for the fact that on boot up, simply having the motors connected to the controller board via the 25-pin (even with ESCs off) draws current and was tapping my limit (manifesting as a ‰ÛÏshort‰Ûù)I see now that, if I disconnect the webcam ESC, and turn on one propeller, the propeller spins and 0.8A is drawn.  Easy to see how having all 3 going would send me over my current limit.Theoretically, I can switch to battery power and all will be fine.  I‰Ûªm a bit concerned about frying components if there really is a short though, so I‰Ûªm going to pick up some fuses first.  I‰Ûªll check the specs, but to be certain, do you know the robot‰Ûªs tolerance?

I go to the cockpit view and enter ‰ÛÏdiagnostics‰Ûù window.  I then Start the procedures with steps 1 thru 4 on the port thruster slider on the cockpit calibration window = nothing happens.  So I switch to the STBD slider and go through steps 1 thru 4 and the Port motor runs.   Next I go to step 5 (on the STBD) thruster slider and = the STBD motor runs.  One ESC in two different positions makes two different motors run‰Û_?So‰Û_, next I go to the STBD ESC as soon as I turn the switch on (and the slider on the diagnostics windo is set at 0) the Port motor starts to run and the Stbd motor starts to twitch.  (again two motors affected by one ESC)  When I try to do step 5 the port engine switched direction.  When I set the slider to zero the port engine continues to run.A little history‰Û_:   the unit functioned properly (with regard to thruster control) in previous bathtub and bench tests.   This is a totally new problem.    The only thing I did was to disconnect and reconnect the battery tubes.

The advantage of soldering the ESC‰Ûªs to the control board are that you‰Ûªll only need to run 3 wires per thruster into the main water-tight housing, otherwise you‰Ûªll need to run 3 for control and 2 for power.

The OpenROV 2.7 motors draw around 7-8 amps at full load, and the board can handle a little more than that, but not much.So what I‰Ûªd say is this:If you‰Ûªre going to run T100 thrusters using the standard OpenROV battery voltage (9.6V, a 3S configuration of LiFePO4 batteries), then you should be OK mounting the ESCs on the controller board.  If you‰Ûªre running at a higher voltage, say 11.1V (a 3S configuration of LiPO batteries) or 12V, then I would recommend against it.  You can do so, but realize that full-power operation of all the motors could end up melting something.-W"

Pinging the address 192.168.254.1 results in a ""Destination not reachable"" It says OpenRov-flash-2.5.1.34 on the flash. The serial is 1628 and interestingly enough on the pre shipping checklist the ""Camera and IMU data streams"" check is circled unlike the others which are just signed off??I've heard about issues with the homeplug not working so I disconnected that and plug the ethernet cable directly into beagleboard with no luck :( When I power the rov up after a while the LED lights on the front start blinking. Is that meant to be an indication of when its started up fully? It also says on the beagleboard site that you can connect to it using http://192.168.7.2/ which also didn't work for me. I've also tried connecting without the webcam plugged in but that didn't help. Visually inspected the wiring inside nothing seems wrong. Also checked the ethernet cable I was using for shorts and it seems fine.So how do I go about troubleshooting this?

You would then need to use an SD card, burn a flash image on it, and then apply it to the beaglebone by booting with the image and waiting for the lights to turn solid indicating a completed re-write of the eeprom.If the lights are Cylon in nature, that indicated the ROV software has properly started up.

If the jumper is not used, the board does not power on at all.The power and ethernet connection on the topside adapter are both lit. However, when I checked the output of the topside box to the tether cable I get 0 V (not 5V, as it is supposed to be).If I connect the tether cable directly to a 5V power source the ROV turns on right away.Could it be that I have got a faulty topside adapter?

The 2.6 version of the ROV below serial number 1200 did not use these components because the recommended batteries at the time were TrustFire batteries. The older versions of the ROV are comparable with the new batteries but an adapter is needed (it is thicker than the 2.7 adapter). Be aware that the old TrustFire batteries and the new Li-FePO4 batteries charge at different voltage levels. This post explains the differences between the two different batteries.The operations manual shows the placement of the polyfuse in the battery pack. It is at the front between the battery and the forward endcap.Everything should be configured out of the box for a fully assembled unit.

Walt_Holm,"             2015-01-20 17:52:41 UTC           ","Hi Joe:  If you've got an OpenROV 2.5, make sure that your topside box is putting 5V USB power over the tether wires.  See the diagram on Dozuki step 78.  You should be able to measure 5V where the tether connects to the topside box.   If that's OK and the unit still doesn't turn on, go back to the wiring of the DB-25 connector, and make sure that you have it done correctly.  It is very easy to mirror image the DB-25 connector and end up with the tether leads in the wrong places.  If that still looks good.......well write back at that point.-W"

My homeplug adapter led adjacent the power adapter is lit and seems to indicate the ethernet from my laptop is connected.  The led furthest away is also lit and seems to be a power indicator.  The middle led, however does not light up.  Nor does my OpenROV indicate that it is powering up.  Thoughts that occur to me... my homeplug adapter is broken.  Or ?  Voltage on the batteries and terminals is good.Thanks,Joe"
Walt_Holm,"             2015-01-21 19:04:34 UTC           ","Hi Joe:   The homeplug adapter doesn't play any role in turning on the ROV.  5V is sent down the tether to the controller board, where an optoisolator sees that voltage and turns on the battery power.  You won't get a center LED on the topside adapter until the ROV turns on.  So....    Go back and carefully check the connections on your DB-25 connector.  It is very easy, and quite common, to attach the wires in a mirror image of what is correct.  If that happens, then the ROV won't turn on when 5V is applied to the tether.-W"

Checked the tether connections on the DB-25, performed the startup again.  Then switched the tether terminals on the homeplug and tried again.  I removed all other connections from the DB-25 so it was just the stbd & port batteries & tether.  Still no startup...On the positive side... I always learn more when things don't work right the first time.Any thoughts?Joe"
Walt_Holm,"             2015-01-28 20:02:35 UTC           ","Hi Joe:   If the DB-25 connector is wired right, the batteries are charged, and you have voltage on the tether, then the ROV should be turning on.  So it's time to dig in in more detail.   Go download the schematic for you controller board off of our GitHub site.  The power switching circuitry is on sheet 3 of the schematic.   Find optocoupler OC1 on your controller board- if you hold the board with the DB-25 connector on the left, it's on the lower right side of the board.  With the controller board plugged in and power on the tether, measure the voltage between  pins 1 and 2 of the optocoupler.  You should be seeing about 1 volt or so.  If there's no voltage there, then you need to trace the circuitry back to the DB-25 connector to see why the tether voltage is not getting through.   Keep us posted on how your debugging goes.-W"

The issue you are seeing is due to the board detection system at some point trying to upload through serial (ttyO1) vs SPI (spidev).  We have an open issue on this but have not yet tracked down what is going on.  This is TYPICALLY a transient problem and cycling power should allow uploading to work again.There is a thread somewhere in the forums where someone mentioned they manually overroad the result of the board detection in the /var/run/rov_board file and changed it from cape to controllerboard.  I have not tested this but if the issue persists that *might* be worth a try.Definitely keep us in the loop!-Brian"

Once all 3 are plugged in, I appear to have full control of all 3 motors.The problem comes when I then plug in the Camera Tilt servo into D11. At that point, some ESCs lose their programming and calibration.  Some will not respond at all while other do in only one direction (but somewhat erratically).  Also, the tilt servo will only operate in one direction from center. Any ideas what could be happening and how to correct?Can someone also recommend which stable software rev I should be using?Many thanks in advance for the help.Charles"

The only remedy is to power cycle the entire system.  ---Additional ESC troubleshooting :I removed the PORT ESC, leaving only the STBD and VERT installed on the board:PORT ESC removed STBD ESC installedVERT ESC installedThis configuration resulted in the PORT AND STBD thrusters chattering?!

Disconnect the D25 connector and measure the impedance between the three motor windings (i.e ESC1A to ESC1B, ESC1A to ESC1C and ESC1B to ESC1C) for each of the motors in turn. You should measure a few hundred milliohms in each case.  If you get an open circuit for any of them, you have a wiring problem.  Next measure the impedance from each of the motor windings (again from the DB25) to those of the other two motors, if it is not an open circuit, you have a wiring problem.Let us know what you find.Adam"

Walt_Holm,"             2015-01-28 19:54:01 UTC           ","Hi Shaun:   Sounds like you're making progress.    The odd behavior when you switch only one ESC on is due to the fact that the BEC (battery eliminator circuit) from the 3 ESCs are ganged together, so that +5V power is provided to the camera tilt platform, and whatever other servos might be plugged into the controller board, if at least one ESC is turned on.  When only one ESC is on, it back-drives 5V into the other ESCs, partially turning them on.   With regards to the port motor chatter, I think you're going to have to do something to narrow down the issue to either the motor or the ESC, and unfortunately that's going to require some desoldering/soldering.  First I would go back and measure the resistances of the port motor wires from the DB-25 very carefully, using an ohmmeter that has a resolution of 0.1 ohm or better.  What you're trying to figure out is whether one of the lead wires of the motor (which is stranded) has some of it's strands broken, making the motor electrically unbalanced.  If the port motor does have some broken lead wire strands, you might want to replace the motor before the lead wire breaks altogether.   If that doesn't find anything, then take your DB-25 connector and swap the wires between the port motor and the starboard motor.  When you plug everything back together, notice which motor chatters.  If it's the port, then the problem is with the motor or it's wiring.  If it's the starboard, then the problem is with the ESC.   Keep us posted on how your testing goes.-Walt"

Danny_Epperson,"             2014-12-28 21:04:14 UTC           ","Hi,Due to our wiring installation, we had to reverse one of the horizontal thrusters via the GUI. We thought this was no problem as was mentioned in the construction guide. Well fast forward almost a year of troubleshooting this little guy for all sorts of issues, and now I think we have identified another software bug. The amount of math done against the thrusters seems to lead to problems. I think it would be simpler to just pass through the command from the Cockpit to the Arduino but I guess OpenROV have their reasons. Our latest problem is that in forward or reverse directions, one motor spins roughly twice as fast as the other. This makes flying the ROV almost impossible. By code and github issue inspection, I can see that you are doing some biasing to get a more linear response from the motors. OpenROV are already aware that this needs to be adjustable (issue #325) but another problem seems to be that this is applied backwards if the ESC is reversed in the OpenROV configuration. https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software/issues/325Here is a video demonstration. You can see that for the starboard thruster, forward is slow and reverse is fast. The port thruster is the opposite, forward goes fast and reverse is slow.

Did all 2.6 Versions come without this sensor? Does it make any sense to buy one and solder it on now? Has anyone used this for anything special?? Do the 2.7 board come with one?(From all my underwater Video / Photo housings I know that there is nothing more disturbing on a dive then having the flood sensor go off at depth (leads to a pretty stressed out deco phase!)...Pressure sensor for Vacuum  (topside) makes more sense as you detect the leak most probably still above water.

Walt_Holm,"             2015-01-09 04:04:29 UTC           ","Hi Gerd and Carsten:   Well, as soon as I finish writing it, we'll post that it's available.  An app note for the controller board has been needed for a while, as not that many people are good at just taking a schematic and being able to use the board for something.  The problem, of course, is that somebody needs to sit down and write that app note, and we're all busy with dozens of other projects.   As for the humidity sensor, the slot has been in there since the very first 2.5 controller boards, since we were thinking way back then of putting leak detection into the software based upon the humidity in the E-tube.  The problem is that the sensor is relatively expensive, and it didn't make the cut for inclusion into the standard production board.  It's easy enough to add yourself at home if you're handy with soldering, but you're going to have to write your own Arduino software to read it and report the results up to the BBB.  At some point we will do some more work on adding flood detection to the stock software, but its not there yet.   As  for the tweak that Brian refers to, if you look at the schematic for Controllers 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 you'll see that I grounded the mounting lug for the humidity sensor.  It turns out that the mounting lug is actually attached to the +V pin of the sensor.  So if you just mount the sensor on the PC board, you will short the +5V supply to ground.  So if you're going to use the sensor, you need to take an X-acto knife and cut the trace that goes from the solder pad of the sensor mounting lug to a nearby via, and from there down to the ground plane.    The next release of the Controller board (2.7A) will fix this issue.   Hope that helps.-Walt"

So after replacing the ESC's completely, unplugging the camera/servo, and reprogramming them, we're noticing two things: first, they still lose programming regularly, and second, that anytime we have the Thrust level at 1-3, everything works OK, but  once we get to 4 or 5, stuff stops working.  For instance, in reverse, the props will spin for about a second, then both stop.  Using multimeters we verified that the voltage stayed constant to the ESC, but the ESC wasn't signalling the props to spin and they'll just stop.

If enough of the wires break, this will create a higher resistance on the motor windings and cause it to lose power.You can carefully inspect your motors for this, though I wouldn't recommend removing them since that just would compound the problem.  The other way to check this would be to get a decent multimeter (one that can measure resistance with a resolution of 0.1 ohm or better), and check the winding resistance for each lead permutation of each motor (A-B, B-C, A-C).  They should all be equal and they should be consistent from motor to motor.To do this you'd have to have the E-tube open and the DB-25 connector detached, so I'd just put this down on the list of things to do the next time you have the thing open for work.-W"

Walt_Holm,"             2013-11-27 17:48:23 UTC           ","Hi Nathan:     Good problem description- here's what the issue with the servo is:Normally the servo gets powered by the battery eliminator circuit (BEC) that exists in each of the 3 ESCs.  They feed +5V power back onto the BEC bus, which then powers the servo.  If you have all the ESCs turned off, since you're having issues with them, then there is no +5V power being generated for the servo.The ""BEC Power"" pads exist to allow somebody to use servos with this Controller Board in a design that doesn't have any ESCs, and therefore doesn't have a BEC to provide power to that buss.   Apply 5V to those pads, and you should have a working servo.Once you verify that the servo is working, we can turn to the ESCs, and once you have at least one of those working, you won't need to apply power to the ""BEC Power"" pads any longer.Walt"

The initial issues were due to my Bench top Power Supply that I was using for testing ( our batteries are not in yet) was in the wrong setting, as soon as I changed it to parallel mode they all worked! That said, we are now in a slightly different position, first of all, the camera doesn't want to start up ( i.e. send data to the Cockpit) when the ESC's are in the ""ON"" position, I need to turn them off, power up the board and cockpit, and then turn on the ESCs, then it works. And there is also another problem. Our Beaglebone has suddenly stopped working, and refuses to boot. the Power LED comes on, but the USer LED's do not. We are in the process of trying to re-flash the Microcontroller with the base software from Beaglebone, and then try again from scratch in an attempt to bring the Beaglebone back to life. If you have any suggestions or help in any of these issues that would be great! Thanks for your help so far, it's been quite useful!Nathan"

I can sympathize with the challenges you're having with the power supply.   One thing you can try if you think you're having bootup power supply issues is to turn the ESCs off while sorting out the other problems.  The ESCs in the kit draw a truly massive current spike when they are first turned on, for I think maybe 10 usec or so.  I'm guessing it's a bug in the ESC firmware (probably the output MOSFETs are all turned on at the same time) but I don't know for sure.  Anyway, this current spike can't really even be handled properly by the lithium cells, and it kicks off the 5V switcher for a short period of time.  The reason the output of the 5V switcher has such a huge capacitor on it is to hold up the 5V bus while the ESCs sort themselves out, and the 5V switcher comes back online.  In time we will likely switch to a different ESC that doesn't have this ""feature"", but we've got bigger fish to fry right now, so that task is on the back burner.If the external power supply you're using can't source as much current as the Lithium cells do, then it may be that the cap on the output of the 5V switcher can't hold up the +5V bus for the length of time that your external power supply needs to recover.  If that happens, the Arduino tries to reset everything (including the ESCs), and the whole process starts all over again.Nathan, If you still have issues finding lithium cells in Canada, you could modify the unit to run on 8 or 10 NiMh C-cells, with 4 on each side, or 5 on each side if you cut yourself some longer battery tubes.  The wiring harness would then need to be changed to hook the battery tubes in series.  We want to test this configuration here at the lab sometime, but again it just hasn't bubbled up to the top of the priority list yet.Anyway, I hope this explanation at least gives you some background as to what might be happening.  Please keep us posted as to how things progress.-Walt"

Walt_Holm,"             2014-11-21 00:41:01 UTC           ","Hi Laura-   I was interested to see in your videos the changes that you had made from the stock ROV, but curious as to your rationale for some of them.   Here at OpenROV HQ we've been using rechargeable 26650 LiFePO4 batteries for the last 9 months or so, and are very pleased with their performance.  Compared to NiMH, they have better energy density, so for a decent battery pack capacity you won't need to use flotation on the ROV to get the buoyancy right.    If you decide to stick with NiMH for future builds, here's a couple of thoughts:- 12V is not needed to run the ROV.  The recommended LiFePO4 battery configuration is 9.6V.  If you use 4 NiMH batteries per side, that would match it at 9.6V.  You'd have less energy available, but also less need for flotation.- Since the NiMH cells are all placed in series, the total vehicle current draw goes through a single set of wires to the electronics tube.  I would consider upgrading the wire for the battery pack from the 20ga supplied with the kit to 18ga.- Similarly, when you bring the power into the vehicle through the endcap and the DB-25 connector, make sure that you bridge the power across both sets of power pins in the DB-25 connector.  The power pins in the DB-25 connector, and the associated blocking diodes on the controller board, are not sized for continuous full-power operation from a single channel.  With the Lithium batteries, the current gets split between two separate channels.Keep posting your videos.  They're great fun to watch!-W"

I was going to start the ESC calibration face, but allas no response whatsoever. I've tried rebooting the ROV, still no response. There is certainly power going to the ESC's since I've been able to do the programming part. There is power going to the motors too, because while doing the programming the motors would do the beepety bop thing and twitch a little for every beep.The servo don't respond either.Lights are controllable, and I have video feed.Any suggestions?186-ScreenShot20141005at21.38.37.png (1.87 MB)      "

So as far as I can see, there is power going to the motors.But when I try to ""move"" the ROV using the arrows, I get absolutely no response from the motors, even if the software seems to responding: the motors, mtarget and fthr telemetry is responding to keyboard input. I have double checked that the ESC's are plugged in correctly, and are as follows:ESC 3 - D8ESC2 - D7ESC 1 - D6Servo - D11When I follow the Dozuki step 97:I start the ROV with all motors off,Then switch on one of the ESC's while holding in the red button.It starts beeping, upon which I release the red button.The ESC continue beeping, as expected.Then press the red button once, upon which the beeping stops, but without the additional final beep, not as expected.Then moving the sliders in any direction in the diagnostics pane does not render any response at all.I have not yet installed the lasers or the IMU, but I don't understand how that can be the reason.-Roy"

*ANNOUNCEMENT* Official Changes to OpenROV 2.6 - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,
Zack,"             2014-09-15 19:29:48 UTC           ","Hello all. There have been two official changes to the OpenROV 2.6 kits and assembled units that are purchased through our webstore. I'd like to take a second to explain what changes were made, why, and how you can also make these changes.Affects OpenROV 2.6 serial numbers 1400 and above.First off, let me start by saying that we at OpenROV HQ had the pleasure of having some amazingly smart and talented folks here over the summer as interns. Most of the changes featured in this post as well as some of the cool things we are planning for the future builds on their hard work, intuition, and enthusiasm. I will credit them, and the work of others where I can.The first change was started at the beginning of this year when one of our stalwarts, Walt, was trying to figure out a way to spend less of his time holding the ""up"" and ""down"" controls through deep dives that required long ascents and descents. His efforts along with no small amount of ingenuity on the part of Laughlin led to the development of a test for better, more efficient and powerful motor and propeller combinations. Through the hard work of our interns, Kevin and Zoe, we've arrived at a solution.Change #1:Vertical prop is now a Graupner 2303.57 57mm racing propThe Graupner racing prop is significantly more powerful while still being efficient. This will allow drivers to dive and surface much more quickly.60-IMG_20140915_111332665.jpg2432x4320 2.37 MB62-IMG_20140915_111314856.jpg4320x2432 2.6 MBSeen above are the three props now included with the OpenROV kit and fully assembled units. From left to right: Graupner models 2308.65, 2303.57(new), and 2308.65L (the L is for 'left hand rotation').If you are having similar issues with deep dives, changing the props is simple enough. The 2303.57 can be bought on several webstores (even amazon.de), most of them in Europe. Modification to old ROVs is easy, as you simply need to break off the old prop and epoxy this one on. If you are having trouble sourcing the 2303.57, other sizes of the same 2303 family behave nearly as well and can be used as a substitute. Lastly, keep the c-clip from your motors, because these puppies are powerful enough to pull the bell right off the motor. If you've already tossed those in the bin, you can buy the part from the all-powerful McMaster catalog HERE. Check out the 2.6 Dozuki for instructions for further information on this.The second change has been part of an ongoing feedback loop from our user base and community. We've seen lots of leaky battery tubes. Some of this is due to the forward battery tube endcap becoming dislodged or having a small leak that only occurs at depth...then on surfacing, the air pushes the cap out.Change #2:Larger diameter o-rings on battery tube endcapsTo help this, we are now using the larger #314 buna-n o-ring. To accommodate this, the acrylic parts to the endcap have also changed. This allows for a much better seal both initially and in shallow waters and at depth. We are hoping to get as much feedback on this as we can in the coming months.64-IMG_20140915_112444727.jpg4320x2432 2.56 MBYou can see the new, larger diameter o-ring endcap on the right.66-IMG_20140915_112509670.jpg4320x2432 2.66 MBThe larger o-ring engages with the sides of the tube much better, which hopefully will reduce leaky endcaps.Upgrading your old endcaps would be recommended if you are having consistently leaky battery tubes. The new o-ring is available on McMaster as part number 9452K387. If you don't have access to a laser cutter, you can send us an email (info@openrov.com) and we will ship one to you. If there is enough demand for this, we may include an item on our store that would include all the parts you need to do this. If you do have access to a laser cutter, this part replaces two of the 3mm pieces. Check out the diagram below, with the new scheme on the left.68-Untitled1.jpg1420x1420 349 KBThanks for all the feedback and help with these issues. Our development thrives on the direction and assistance of our community. While I would only recommend either of these two changes to folks who are having specific issues, feel free to reach out to us if you are having trouble implementing these changes in your own ROV. Also, please post on the comments section any feedback.Thanks again to our hard working interns and our wonderful community contributors,~Zack"

Granted some of the peripherals information is not easily available. But, with an open source Linux kernel and a fully documented processor. It is far less constrained.

If not, you can disable the depth sensor and IMU in the AConfig.h file in the arduino code to avoid seeing those messages.

Hoping someone can help with these.First some background: I'm working with Open ROV kit 2.6. Batteries are fully charged. I received the kit around July 15th so I *think* the latest firmware is already loaded and I should not need to load from a SD card or get new firmware from GitHub (which seems to be from Open ROV 2.5 anyway).Problems:I've seen the ""camera not working"" problem multiple times. I've had it working on my test bench, but in my underwater tests it always seems to fail to show anything. This has nothing to do with the water, just murphy's law that when you want to use it you're out of luck. Anyway, I saw some posts from June giving various workarounds - like reloading firmware, stopping the cockpit and restarting, etc. Have the experts on this forum converged on the best solution to this problem?In trying to solve problem #1, I re-installed firmware. This worked on the testbench but when I used the ROV in the water the camera again was not working. I tried to re-install the firmware at that point and the installation seemed to fail. It started compiling but then seemed to hang there forever. I attempted to reboot the ROV by pulling the USB power cord from my computer but that did not seem to work. I was never able to connect to the ROV again from my (Chrome) browser. LEDs sortof look like they are going through the boot sequence but I can't really tell. I also tried to reboot by disconnecting the USB and one of the ROV battery packs but again, after booting I could still not connect. This is a problem because I can't re-install firmware if I can't connect through Chrome. What do I need to do in order to reset the ROV to be sure it will reboot correctly? If I cannot connect to the ROV via Chrome, is there another way to reset the ROV, or download firmware to it?My laser lights don't work. They work when plugged into the +/-5 volt socket and aligned them during assembly, but now that they are plugged into +/- P2 per instructions, they do not work. I have tried hitting a variety of keyboard keys including '/', '\', 'L', etc. No dice. Also tried measuring voltage across P2 as I do this but don't see any differential. Any ideas?Thanks in advance for any assistance.Jeff"

Jeff_Hughes,"             2014-08-12 14:42:34 UTC           ","Hey guys, thanks for the suggestions so far. They've been helpful.Last night I decided to try booting the ROV again and this time it worked. This was with the electronics just sitting on my workbench (not encased in the clear PVC container). This time the ROV booted up. At that point I reloaded the firmware and again the ROV booted up and the camera was correctly showing a video image. Then I slid the electronics back into the clear PVC electronics container and put the caps on both ends. At this point I noticed that the video image was frozen and that the controls would not work. The ROV software was essentially hung.It seems like there are a couple of possible causes. First, the white wires that run to the DB25 are just long enough to reach, so they are pulled taught when I put the boards inside the PVC tube. It is possible this causes some of the pins on the DB25 to touch together and short out some connections. The other possibility is that the board is flexing just a small amount when I put the whole thing inside the PVC tube, again causing some kind of hardware issue. Keep in mind that this all worked the day before, so I'm just speculating as to why it would have stopped working when I put the electronics back in the tube.Anyway after that event I took the electronics back out and set them on the bench again. Tried to reboot a couple of times but no luck. Then downloaded new software per Darcy's suggestion and rebooted from the SD card. Still no luck. Downloaded Putty and attempted to connect via SSH but again no luck.When I boot up the lights on the topside board seem to do the right thing and the lights on the arduino board also seem to do the right thing - although it's tough to know for sure. I thought there used to be a blue LED somewhere under the beagle board that would light up during the boot sequence and I don't see that anymore. If I let everything run for 5 minutes or so I notice the middle yellow light on the top side board goes out and the TPWR light on the arduino starts flashing 1 second on then 4 seconds off (repeatedly). So that's not right.Are there diagnostics I can run to verify the hardware? Any suggestions??"

Details: http://rayhightower.dev/blog/2014/08/19/openrov-assembly-challenges/Summary of SymptomsWith the cockpit software running and attached to the OpenROV:If I turn on any of the three ESCs, two of the motors (vertical and port) start running at full blast. The starboard motor remains stationary.While the V and P motors continue to run at full blast, the starboard motor responds to the cockpit slider controls as expected: +1 makes S run full blast on one direction, -1 sends S full blast in the other direction, and 0 stops the S motor completely. During this exercise, V and P continue at full blast.Turning off the ESC stops the V and P motors.When I turn on any of the ESCs, the camera servo jumps slightly, about 10 degrees. And then the V and P motors run full blast.When the cockpit software is not running (and the Google Chrome browser is completely closed):Turning on an ESC has no effect on the motors.The camera servo jumps slightly, about 10 degrees, as it did with the cockpit software running. But the motors remain stationary.Interesting behavior!More details and previous troubleshooting steps are here: http://rayhightower.dev/blog/2014/08/19/openrov-assembly-challenges/Thanks,Ray"

That way I will be able to visually check where I am and as well if I get caught up I will be able to recover the float and to pull up on it without relying on the strength of the teather to recover it.

I have a 2.5 version ROV and end caps. After going through the forums and looking at a how-to video on how to properly seal the end caps, my electronics tube is still leaking.My test setup is the empty tube, plunger in one side and vacuum pump on the other, just as Eric describes on this discussion  I pull a vacuum 50-60 kPa on the vacuum pump and then submerge it in a container.I started with just a single layer of teflon tape and then in followings tests increased to three layers, but I am still getting leaks in the tube :( In my last test, it looks like the water is coming in between the teflon tape and the end cap.

It's almost the exact same as the v2.5 kit. We had to make slight changes to the controller board due to to manufacturing changes of the Tenda homplug adapters. We struggled with whether to even call this another version, but decided it would probably be worth it. We also made some changes to the inner acrylic assembly (to make it easier to build). As well as making the end caps more robust (we'll have end cap upgrade kits available very soon for anyone who wants to make a change). And now the BeagleBone Black ships with OpenROV software loaded onto it! Just plug it in and go.If you purchased a kit after December 16th, you've atually already been sent an v2.6 kit. There are a few changes to the assembly instructions, and we'll have those up on Dozuki very soon. (It's close enough that you'll very likely be able to figure out how to do it yourself.)Let me know if you have any other questions!"

I bought all the parts independently, but I can not assemble them right now due to this problem."
Walt_Holm,"             2014-01-21 21:39:36 UTC           ","Here's some background information for those who are curious:   The change from 2.5 to 2.6 was forced by the discovery (by somebody on the Forum) that the design of the Tenda HomePlug adapters had changed, and that the Tenda Revision 2.0 adapters would not fit on the V2.5 OROV Controller board.  Yikes!  Some quick E-mails to our Tenda rep revealed that yes, the design had changed, but somehow he hadn't notified us of this.  We had some discussions here at OROV HQ whether or not to try to buy up a big stock of the old Tenda V1.1 adapters, since production and sales of the current ROV design were in full-swing, and we didn't want to perturb that.  But after some head-scratching, we realized that we could modify the design of the Controller Board so that it was compatible with both the old and the new Tenda adapters.   So, off we went, updating the design of the electronics.  The controller board schematic stayed mostly the same, but the layout of the central portion of the board changed significantly to allow the new adapters to plug in, while still keeping the pads for the old adapters.  On the Tenda V2.0 design, the LEDs are on the power board rather than the logic board, so, since the ROV doesn't use this power board, we had to add some LEDs to the Controller board to show the status of the Homeplug adapter.  We rolled a couple of other updates into the board as well- the holes for mounting the ESC power leads were opened up just a touch, there was some filtering added to the ESC current monitors, and the BB Cape ID EEPROM was added back in, in support of future auto-ID software.    In the end it all worked out OK- the boards are stuffed in a configuration where the Tenda V2.0 adapters plug right in, as before.  If you have an old V1.1 adapter, you can still use it, but you have to unsolder a couple of headers, and stuff in a couple of sockets.  The new LEDs work well at allowing you to see the status of the HomePlug adapter from outside the ROV.  The 2.6 controller boards are 100% software-compatible with the old 2.5 controller boards.   The change in HomePlug adapter boards forced our hand in redesigning the top-side adapter as well.  A number of folks had had problems putting together the V2.5 topside adapter, so, since we needed to build something with LEDs to display the topside adapter status, we decided to put together a complete board that eliminates all the soldering and fussing involved with putting together the topside adapter.  This new board has a voltage regulator as well as the 3 status LEDs for the HomePlug adapter, and the tether connection is now made through some spring terminals rather than screw terminals.  The Tenda HomePlug adapter plugs into this board similar to the way it does on the controller board.  There's no soldering of any kind required.   So, while all this was going on, we were digesting the results of the open-water testing from Lake Tahoe in late October.  The biggest takeaway was that our current main endcap design was just too twitchy for long-term use.  The manufacturing tolerance stackup between the acrylic tube and the laser-cut endcaps was too wide for the O-ring to handle, even after fussing with Teflon tape, latex balloons, and the like.  So Eric bit the bullet and redesigned the endcaps, changing the layer stackup in a way that allowed the O-ring to be greatly increased in diameter.  There were also some changes made to the location of the wiring channel, that increase the strength of the endcaps.   The final changes that were made to OROV 2.6 involved simplifying the internal structure of the ROV.  Some areas that required doublers of 1/8"" acrylic were changed to a single piece of 1/4"", which is significantly stronger, as well as not requiring any build time.  The position of the motors was moved a bit as well, to try to improve the balance and the driveability of the ROV.   So, the 2.6 unit is easier to build, and more robust. What more can you ask for?   One of the objectives for our recent trip to the Sea of Cortez was to give the OROV 2.6 vehicles an extended test in sea water.  More on that in some future blog posts, but the main thing we found out was that the new main endcap design is massively better than the older 2.5 design.  So much so that we'll be offering new endcap kits to allow people to upgrade their older endcaps to the new style.  No teflon tape, no latex balloons, it just pretty much works.-W"

There may be some V1.1 Tenda adapters being kept around OROV HQ as spares, or there may be a way you can do an exchange of your old V2.5 controller board for a new one.

Please excuse any obvious queries -- I just want to be clear on the build steps. To what do the red/black wires from the LED lights connect?  There is no mention of this in the build instructions (2.5 and 2.6). Based on the soundless video, I believe the connection is to J1 of the controller board but the image is dark. If this is correct, are the wires just jammed into the holes or is there a better means of securing the wires to the board?When/where are the laser guides attached? No mention is made of these items in the V2.6 guide.Is there a preferred orientation for the main acrylic tube? Is the flat end supposed to go down?  Should the camera housing be aligned in an up/down plane or tilted downward?How is the wiring for the DB25 connector best bent/coiled so that the assembly fits in the tube? WWhat are the current ESC calibration instructions? It seems that this should be done before the final assembly. Should the motors work w/o the initial setup/calibration? (mine didnt)What is the URL for the OpenROV (I assume its http://192.168.254.1). I saw a port mentioned (8080) but that doesn't appear to be necessary.What's the point of the plungers inside the cut syringe tubes? When are the plungers themselves cut? Why have them at all?What does one do if the positive end of the battery tube does not make contact with the batteries? I added some layers of solder to extend the contact plate but this seems kludgy. Does anyone else have this issue?What holds the propellor motor housing onto the shafts? I can see how in the forward direction the force would push the propellors onto the shaft but what happens in reverse? Are the extra (6) wires just left exposed?Does the USB cord to the camera have to be so long? Could it be cut/shortened to make that end of the housing cleaner/easier fitting? Has anyone done this?Could someone add some ""finished"" photos of the boards/wires as well as closeups of completed builds so that we can assure that everything is where it needs to be?Once assembled, where does the IMU attach to the ROV?Thanks!"

We're working around the clock to update the instructions and many of your questions will help us formulate a better how to.  A few quick answers to keep you going while we build better instructions:1. We've got this, currently its step 46.2. Currently we're still working this out...I know this is really sloppy...but very soon we should have a step or two on this.  Stay tuned!3. Flat edge down towards the battery tubes.  Definitely we're going to add a step about this.4. Straight forward.  If the servo arm has been centered (see dozuki on this...we just added a diagram) then you can tilt up then down with the cockpit.5. Done correctly, it should just be the length needed to the epoxy with a little extra...pushing the endcap on should be all that is needed.6. We're going to add a step and a video soon but until then check the wiki here http://wiki.openrov.com/index.php/Programming_the_ESC.7. We've made a change to include this.8. The plungers allow you to close the tube without creating a positive pressure.  Put the endcap in, the the plunger.  The Dozuki will be changed to include a step about cutting them to length to fit within the shell.9. I would probably solder on a conductive metal washer...this is the first we've heard of this...interesting.  Please let me know if this is still a problem.10. The magnets are strong enough to hold the motor bell rotor onto the stator for sure.  Make sure it engages fully (meaning-its pushed down all the way).11. Yes, but hot glue the ends to prevent hosing.12. Haven't tried this yet.  In theory, yes you can make it shorter.13. We will be updating the dozuki constantly.14. I like to put mine underneath the V in OpenROV on the starboard aft side.Best,~OROV"

Worked fairly well once I figured out the correct IP address and port to use in Putty: 192.168.254.1:3131 The address is fair enough, but the port required some searching.Then enabling the ""1"" in the correct places went fine. Had some trouble exiting and saving the session until I realised I had to press escape to leave edit mode. Was then able to save using the ""wq""Once I had loaded the updated software into the Arduino, OROV booted and came up with compass and depth data among others. Turned out that the little chip inside the epoxy is not 100% aligned with bottom of acrylbase, so it shows a tilt of 6 degrees when flat on table. I guess I need to remove the IMU module and glue it back on with a counteroffset to get it straight.Calibrated depth in cockpit, still shows about -0.3 meter  at surface. I guess I can live with that. The compass calibration I'm not quite sure how to perform. I have done similar calibration on my diving computer with built in compass, that is done by rotating the compass 360 degrees. Currently the compass does not appear to show correct heading, but is updating when turning the ROV.  With regards to organizing the interior of the electronics module, the problem is partly my own fault, I added a total of 10 wires in spare, so the 25 pin is full. That cramps up the space a bit.Have bent each wire individually 90 degrees and tried to spread it out more as a flat cable versus a round cable bundle as it originally was. Have also cut the USB cable for the camera and re-soldered it without the excessive cable. Hopefully this will help up with the ""claustrophobia"" inside the tube. "

I guess if you remove it you'll destroy it.I am missing some kind of guide how to calibrate the sensor to.

Watching at some static html code on the ROV i could see, that the buttons are not linked to something.

The plan is not to try to remove the card from inside the epoxy and reglue it. I was more thinking of tilting the hole IMU module a bit to the side compared to the ROV chassis to compensate for the offset.You may be right about the sensor calibration, it says -0.3 meters whether it is calibrated or not, so the calibration may not do anything at all.But at least the data is coming in, eventually I'm sure someone more fluent in programming than me will look into the matter."

Potted the endcaps and battery tubes. I also sealed one of the vent holes on one of the end caps, I don't see the point in having two, one should be sufficient.I also added fuses to the battery power leads, since I experienced that one of them broke off the soldering point on the 25 pin connector. Worst case, short circuiting LiPo batteries could be nasty with fire as a result.Well, the E-90FL has now cured, and I have done a water test in my bath tub.

Have not looked into it yet. Received the kit early February, so presumably it is the latest version from github: https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-image/blob/master/CHANGELOG.mdSee that the latest image is dated 26/28-11-2013, so I guess this is the one  I use. Or is there a way to see the revision no in the cockpit? Have not really looked.Hysol 90: The European Equivalent apparently is Loctite 9489, but that also appears to be a Holy Grail amongst the epoxy alchemists, at least not easy to come by in Norway. I'm sure there are other stuff that will do the trick, but to be the first one to try it is a leap of faith.Another issue: IMU. As described earlier I connected the IMU/Depth module as per procedure, updated the config file in Putt and uploaded it into the Arduino. After that it worked great once I changed the position of the module, except for the compass data, which was far off by approx. 80 degrees, but was updating. The OROV cockpit gave me associations to flying a F-16 for a moment as I watched the screen flicker with artificial horizons and banking indications as I performed break dance with my Rover.Next day as I wandered into my little workshop with a cup of coffe and thinking happy thoughts, I  cranked up the  Rover, suddenly all IMU data was dead as a dudu. All that remains is the depth and temperature data, which still ticks along. I had not done anything to it, it worked like a charm the day before, but now suddenly the IMU part is dead, the cockpit is showing 0 for value for all pitch, yaw, roll and whatever. I tried to upload the Arduino again, but the same disappointing result. If it had been a wiring problem, I would suspect the depth values to be dead as well since it is communicating on a I2C bus. That leaves me with 2 alternatives as far as I can see, either the IMU circuitry on the board has gone to Silicon heaven, or there is something dodgy in the software department. If anyone else has experienced something similar, or have some cunning ideas, feel free to share them here."

Listed with each assembly section is a Bill Of Materials (what parts and tools you'll need), general notes for the assembly (what the best working space is, how long it should take, what each part is for, etc), the instruction set itself, and notes on what to do if something goes wrong.åÊ We hope that improvements will be made periodically by builders who find tricks and rules of thumb to make the build go more smoothly.åÊRemember, if you have questions, you can always visit the OpenROV builder's forum at this linkBuilder's ForumGood luck, and happy building!åÊåÊåÊåÊ**************************1. Cutting Out Parts**********************Items needed:Materials/ PartsNote: although the OpenROV 2.3 design is metric, most stores in the US will only sell acrylic in English units, so we've provided dimensions in inches for this section.One 24"" x 18"" sheet of 1/8"" (actually .118"") thick translucent blue acrylic.One 24"" x 12"" sheet of 1/8"" thick white acrylicOne 4"" OD, 3.75"" ID (1/8"" wall thickness) by greater then 7in (180mm) long piece of clear cast acrylic tubing (Note, that tube must be CAST rather then extruded, as extruded tubes usually have longitudinal distortion which would interfere with camera image)ToolsLaser cutter connected to a computer (we use a 24"" x 18"" Epilog 60W Helix)Chop sawMasking tapeAssembly Notes:24"" x 18"" sheet will be used for main OpenROV structural parts and 24"" x 12"" sheet will be used for end cap componentsRemove backing on side of plastic that will be facing the laser source should be removed to prevent flameAssure that outline of ROV parts will be cut as vectors while OpenROV logo and serial number are set to be rasteredFor 60W Epilog Helix laser cutter, settings should be 60% speed at 30% power for raster, and 18% speed at 90% power (5000kHz frequency) for vectorFocus laser toward top of plastic sheet to assure clear rasteringCut out test piece with both raster and vector components in upper left corner of sheet before starting to assure settings and adjustments are correctThe main parts pattern (cut out from the 24"" x 18"" sheet) should take about 8 minuets to finishThe end cap parts parttern (on the 24"" x 12"" sheet) should take bout 4 minutesEach OpenROV has a unique serial number.åÊ If you plan to laser cut your own OpenROV structure, please request a serial number by sending an email with the subject heading ""SERIAL REQUEST"" to openrov@gmail.com several days before you plan to cut.åÊ Once we get your request, we will issue a serial number which will be valid for the next three days.åÊ If you don't cut during that time, just let us know and we can reissue you a new number.Procedure:1. Remove backing from one side of 24"" by 18"" acrylic sheet and place on laser cutter platform with backing-less side facing up2. Focus laser to top surface of sheet3.

Using a razor, etch lines in two places along the length of the shell on the opposite side of the logo (which will eventually be the inside of the shell) as shown.åÊ A carpender's square can be used to etch the lines at right angles to the forward and aft edges of the shell.åÊ These lines will be used to assure the piece is being bent in precisly the right spot.åÊ27-Bendinglineetches.png734x491 16.1 KB4. Remove any additional backing on the shell5. Make a note of the minuet and second, and place the shell -logo down- onto the heat bender so that one of the etched lines is aligned with the heating element strip heater.åÊ The shell should be in roughly the center of the heating area.6. After 2 minuets has elapst, varify that the plastic is easely bendable over the heating element and carefully lift the shell off the heater from one end.åÊ If the shell is not yet flexable, ad time as needed until flexability is achieved.åÊ Make note of how long this takes so that the same timeing can be used for the other bend.7. Immediately after removing the shell from the strip heater, bend it by hand along the etched line (with the line on the inside of the bend), being vary cairful to assure the etched line is co-linear with and in the center of the bend8. Place the shell on the already prepaired jig and hold until cool (no longer flexable)9. Repeat steps 3-8 for the other bend line.åÊ Be sure to place the shell on the strip heater for the same amount of time as the previous bend or bend radii may be different.åÊåÊåÊ****************(3) Assembling and gluing the inner structure****************Items Needed:Materials/ Parts:FirewallTopTube BracesTools:Acrylic cement (we use Weld-On 4)Acrylic cement despensing syringeAssembly Notes:Paper towels should be handyLow viscosity acrylic cement that is drawn between pieces using the capillary effect is preferable over thicker glues which must be applied directly to each surfaceAlways re-cap acrylic cement container immediately after filling syringe to prevent evaporation and spillingGlue pieces over several layers of paper towel or other material that will absorb excess glue.åÊ A piece of wax paper can be placed under the towels to prevent glue from getting on the table you are using.The tabs coming out of the firewall may not align perfectly with the outer shell at first.åÊ If this is the case, a file may be used to trim the tabs as necessary.åÊProcedure:At this point, description of each step would just be silly, so instead, assembly instructions are shown below Lego-style.åÊ Brief written instructions may be added later to help with procedures that are not intuitive- if you have any questions about the assembly, please feel free to list them in the Comments section of this page, and we'll try to address them in this instruction set.29-OpenROV2.3AssemblyInstructionSet.png1280x10000 421 KB"

We're also missing the springs used in the battery packs and the wiring for the motors.  Stay posted and we'll have that up as soon as we know!In the current design, we don't charge the batteries through the tether.  To do this, one would have to use a higher voltage.  There is a way to do this, but it wouldn't be safe for people who aren't very familiar with electronics to try, so we've omitted that approach for now."

Don't do that- there's no need!  We should make it more clear in the instructions, but the internal structure is meant to clip into the shell mechanically and be held in place when you screw the cross bars down. This way you can take the internal housing out the get better access to the parts later on.  Make sense?Eric"
