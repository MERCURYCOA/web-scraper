One of the three pins on the connector is not connected to anything, but that pin on the vehicle is used for charging the batteries.Keep in mind that if the tether is extended very far beyond 100m (maybe over 120m or so) it will start to have trouble delivering enough power to support the topside, especially durring startup. Weâ€™ve been considering an adapter that could supplement power to the topside to allow (much) longer tethers, and Iâ€™d love to gauge how much interest there would be in that sort of a thing.Best of luck with your project- please let us know what youâ€™re aiming to do!Eric"Trident return home option,https://forum.openrov.com/t/trident-return-home-option/7002,OpenROV Product Support,56,4d,0,Trident return home option - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,jsalasky,"It would be nice if it had a return home button, for those times you lose it."Trident control,https://forum.openrov.com/t/trident-control/6256,Trident,1.3k,13d,14,Trident control - Trident - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tore_Skjefstad,When I ordered the trident in 2015 it was suposed to be using a Pc-controller. Is this not an option anymore? Do i need android to use the Trident?Next question : Is it possible to use the Trident without the wireless buoy? Can it be wired directly into the controller?,,,,,,oddgeir,"Hi<br>I just received my Trident, and been using it for a few days now. Right now, the only way to control it, is via an android app. This app is still in itâ€™s â€œbaby stageâ€ but is working quit nice. From what I have red they are working with upgrading and expanding this app with new features. They are also planing to make an app for ios, and I just saw an ad for an ios developer.I have not seen anyting regarding a windows app, but hopefully some one from the OpenROV team can answer that.My recommendation is to go for the JXD Singularity, then you have an all in one controller, with minimum start up challenges. You can buy this from openrov or directly from China via ebay. I bought mine from China, this is the cheper alternative, but comes with a small risk of geting a unit that is not working as it should. (According to some YouTube reviews, there have been some that has defects, hopefully they have improved on there internal controls). Mine was working as it should.<br>If you buy it from openrov, they have preinstalled the app, and made shoure it is working as it should.My next step will be to connect video goggles to the JXD to eliminate the problem with sunlight on the screen. But form what I have seen so far, is that itâ€™s important to learn to control the Trident, before you start to use video goggles. Because it take some practice to know where you Trident isâ€¦I was also focused on using a laptop with a Bluetooth controller, but that was before I got to try it.The JXD also can fit in the hard case.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/5/5f585c6aba96fd0657a8d5f263ba7faf1104a83c.jpeg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/5f585c6aba96fd0657a8d5f263ba7faf1104a83c"" title=""C1AE6423-13FC-42F8-B5E3-B4918F3CF0AC.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  alt=""image"" width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">C1AE6423-13FC-42F8-B5E3-B4918F3CF0AC.jpeg</span><span class=""informations"">4032x3024 2.02 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div>",,,,,,Tore_Skjefstad,"Thanks a lot for information <img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:"">",,,,,,marcolinger,"I confirm, the JDX (bought directly from Openrov with the Trident) is a pefect choice. The app is working fine but there is certainly a lot of room to improve it, mainly to give the possibility to register in high resolution onto the memory inside rhe Trident.<br>For me, the only problem is that you see nearly nothing on the screen when you are near the sea and have a bright sun. This is not a problem of the JDX and will not be diminuished by another screen. I used my anorak to cover my head and the screen in order to get a darker environment. This works but is not particularly nice when it is hot ! The best solution are probably dji or similar googles.<br>As the Sardinian sea in our place get deep only verry far from the coast, I used the 100 meter lenghts but went only to 2,20 meter deep. I had no problem at all with the orientation. Once you understand how works the compass indication it is pretty<br>Easy.<br>An important recommendation is to clean with attention the motor compartiments. In mine I had a lot of fine sea sand. Also the salted water has to be removed carefully (not know how to do this with the central propellor ?).Conclusion : a perfect product ! I really do not regret my investment.",,,,,,maurosacchi,"Waiting for my unit and having the same issue. When I ordered it the advertised way of working was via laptop, now its only android tablet. I have only laptop and iOS devices, so basically have to wait to get a iOS app and hopefully the possibility to use my laptop. Otherwise I will have to spend another 400$ plus custom and shipping to buy an android controller, which is not my preference.<br>Annoying have to say. What is the timeline for iOS/laptop use?",,,,,,marcolinger,"In my opinion, having used the Trident, a computer is the worst solution. Far to large, heavy and fragil. If you do not want to buy the Openrov solution, take a non expensive android tablet. This will do a good job at a low price. The only disadvantage, based on my experience, is that you will probably be a little less precise in the guidance of the rov as you donâ€™t have well calibrated joysticks.",,,,,,Paolo,Does anyone tryed to fly the Trident using an Android emulator on a Win laptop?

I do not have many android devices and so Iâ€™m trying to test it with what I have now available. Well, I started with a Win laptop running different android emulators (i.e Memu, Bluestacks etcâ€¦)â€¦it doesnâ€™t work.<br>Now, Iâ€™m trying with the ZIDOO X9S  (a tv box but almost a pc running android 6.0). The OpenROV app works well. The thrusters controls and compass signal works without any lag. The video feed works well but there is a lag of about 25 seconds between what the Trident see and what is shown in the tvâ€¦ Any one has suggestions in order to eliminate this video lag?",,,,,,halmueller,"Iâ€™m not completely happy with the JDX.Itâ€™s fast, and the OpenROV Cockpit software works well. I appreciate the external gamepad controls and I think theyâ€™re easier to use than touchscreen controls would be.My two gripes are that the screen is not very bright, and that the JDX has no internal compass.Itâ€™s very hard to read the screen contents in sunlight.An internal compass would make it easier to fly because Iâ€™d be able to translate the Vehicle Heading indicator to a real direction of travel and visualize that when Iâ€™m on the water.It does the job but I think there must be better alternatives.",,,,,,finn1,"Hi Oddgeir!Are you from Norway?

We brought the ROV back into shore (controls were still working). when it was back on shore the video returned but then when we tried to redeploy it froze before it was even in the water. We tried restarting the app and the ROV a few times and checked the connectors repeatedly. We even tried running it off my phone.No matter what we did it would either freeze completely for periods of time (several minutes) before returning, not be able to find the video publisher (ie. offer to let me control the ROV without a camera feed), or in the case of running it off my phone, run with so much lag that it was impossible to pilot.Has anyone else encountered this and do you know a fix?CheersTomasz",,,,,,james1,"I noticed on my Trident that I had a .5 second delay on the video.

Certainly neither of these video issues should happen. If you wouldnâ€™t mind emailing these descriptions to our support team (<a href=""mailto:support@openrov.com"">support@openrov.com</a>) we can track the issues through our system. In the meantime, the basic things to double check are signal quality (make sure there is a good radio path between the WiFi Topside and your device, and that there isnâ€™t a lot of other interference on those frequencies like lots of other WiFi or Bluetooth devices). Also, sometimes video can cut out if the battery level is very low, so itâ€™s good to double check that your battery isnâ€™t almost dead.Presuming it isnâ€™t either if these issues, Support is probably the best route to go so we can get more hands-on.Thanks again for reporting this stuff back!Eric",,,,,,charlesdc,"Hi <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/james1"">@james1</a> ,Another potential issue in your situation is that your device either doesnâ€™t have dedicated H264 decoding hardware and is falling back to a software decoder, which could affect decoding latency, or you may have a hardware decoder that is making certain assumptions about the streamâ€™s characteristics which introduces unnecessary latency.Generally, the wifi hardware of a device is the first place I suspect problems, and then the decoding hardware is where I look next.If you can tell me the exact model number of your android tablet, I can dig in deeper!Thanks,<br>Charles",,,,,,james1,"Hi Charles<br>Thank you.<br>I previously sent a email and video to Zack so you may have seen this already.<br>But the Tablet is<br>Samsung Galaxy Tab A<br>Model # SM -T350<br>Android version 7.1.1Please let me know if you need anything else.<br>James Moskito",,,,,,tpedlow51,"thanks for your reply Eric, I did talk to support and they said more or less what youâ€™ve just told me.

Iâ€™ve got 300-400 m of tether that we use to inspect underwater pipes, tanks and what not. However, I noticed that the Trident connector seems to have 3 connections, so I suppose there are 3 wires in the tether, but there are only 2 in the OpenROVâ€™sâ€¦ Was someone brave enough to cut open one of his/her Trident tether?If the tether are not compatible, I would like to know where to find some compatible tether, because our applications often require more than 100m of tether.Thank you,",,,,,,Eric_Stackpole,"Hey <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/samuel.lambert"">@samuel.lambert</a>- The tether itself is the same as what weâ€™ve sold for the kits, and the only two of the three pins of the connector are attached to the (two) wires inside the tether. The third pin is used for charging when that connector is attached.The challenge youâ€™d face with a longer tether (over about 120m) is that not enough current would be able to make up the tether to power the topside. For longer tether lengths, one would need to provide external power to the topside. Doing that requires a bit of technical know-how, and we havenâ€™t yet organized that information in a way thatâ€™s easy to describe here.

Is this the best we can expect ??",,,,,,charlesdc,"Hi <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/julianlaurence"">@julianlaurence</a>,Most of the videos we have posted on the website were using the 1080p stream from Trident, which is why they generally look better than 720p recordings that users have been posting.Trident has two video streams: one at 720p30, which is optimized for transmission over wifi to achieve low latency and reduce lost frames (and thus has lower visual quality), and a 1080p30 stream which is optimized for high quality footage. The bandwidth requirements for the 1080p video are generally too high to deliver a reliable piloting experience, so that stream is designated to be recorded to internal memory on Trident, and downloaded later after the dive. We record the 720p video live on the userâ€™s mobile device so that they have an immediately reviewable video, or a backup in case the Trident is somehow lost before they can sync the HQ video. In the currently deployed Beta software, the onboard recording feature has not yet been released, so the videos being posted are from the 720p stream, which is lower quality and can have missing frames.I uploaded a recent dive that <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/codewithpassion"">@codewithpassion</a> and I did earlier in the year using an alpha version of the onboard recording software.

I read in other posts, that the wifi signal under water can go to 10-15 cm.  Is this true in the production trident?  Also is the SSID and password for the wifi, the same as the TopSide buoy?Thoughts on this approach?  I am about to drop $100 on the project, and I just want a little assurance that this is NOT a non starter.Thanks in advance,<br>Jeff",,,,,,Jim_N,"Immediate thoughts are weight and buoyancy. Positioning on the ROV is another consideration. Itâ€™s ok to drop the CG from ROV center, but you want to ensure you donâ€™t drop the CB or youâ€™ll flip the ROV over as soon as you drop it in the water. Thereâ€™s a righting moment that you will create when you start moving CG and CB around.Software wise, sounds totally doable. I played a little with the NODEMCU using Lua.However, electromagnets could cause adverse interference with the on-board electronics. I donâ€™t know for sure but itâ€™s something youâ€™ll want to test. I used electro magnets for payloads on quad rotors a few years ago and though cool, played havoc with the INS. We had to add metal shieldingâ€¦awful idea, lol. Didnâ€™t want to spend money on a Mil spec shielded INS at the time.I Canâ€™t give you assurance, but it would be a good experiment for the community. Iâ€™ve seen people drop a lot more on physical science impossibilities, so 100 bucks for an education is pretty good.Breaking it down:One thing I havenâ€™t had a chance to do yet is analyze the wifi and start digging into whatâ€™s there. One thing that has been absent is Trident API and hierarchy documentation. But, I have full faith it will be out soon.Interested to hear how it goes!Jim",,,,,,Jim_N,"Ok, so you got me invested in this.Do you really need a 25Kg lifting force magnet? One thing that just hit me is that aside from the weight you are going to add to the ROV from the magnet, power board, power supply, and the communications widget, you have payload housing to consider, and THEN you need to consider how much added mass to lift and bring to the surface.You selected a 25kg magnet. Not only is that big, itâ€™s going to have a significant static field when engaged, so you need to characterize this.How much is all this going to weigh? and How are you going to hand the buoyancy? The last thin you want o do is add weight to the ROV and not increase the buoyant force. Now youâ€™re talking foam. And even more foam with you really want to bring 2.5Kg up from the dark depths of the underworld. (what it can lift is the lifting force divided by 10)I think we can make some good engineering design decisions by first looking at the requirements of what you would like to do, then how much itâ€™s going to weigh and size, power (SWAPC - Size Wieght Power cost analysis). Itâ€™s not hard, but trust me, do this first before you drop money.Letâ€™s think about it.",,,,,,Jim_N,"Final question for the evening, How do you plan to ensure that when you drop the hook, youâ€™ll hit your mark?",,,,,,jwusch,"Awesome questions Jim.  So I am working in Freshwater.  I was thinking of attaching a secondary tether to the hook, so when it was detached, I would move the ROV away, and retrieve the object by hand.  I was going to position the payload and hook off the front of the ROV, but now that you mention Center of Gravity, I am having second thoughts about it.  Perhaps I can add a clear enclosure like this:  <a href=""https://www.polycase.com/ml-44f-1508"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.polycase.com/ml-44f-1508</a> and put in a secondary camera at lower res pointing down, to help with positioning.  Would the air contained in the enclosure help with the buoyancy issue.  I guess I need to break out the University Engineering Textbooks :).  I was thinking the 25kg, since  the adafruit link mentions a pickup force of 5-10 times less.  I was hoping to dual purpose the EM to attract any small metal items on the floor by positioning the trident over them and activating the EM.I am working in super low visibility, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs59Uczw2dk&amp;t=100s"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs59Uczw2dk&amp;t=100s</a>.  and 3M of depth.

I think it would work once you dealt with the new buoyancy characteristics. Whatâ€™s the weight of the hook?That visibility isnâ€™t too bad.

Can you hack together a quick tool (Java, c, anything) that could export data from couchbase?Based on my experience so far asking for help on the couchbase forum, Iâ€™m really hoping you would switch to vanilla sqlite in a future version.

This same freezing has seen with complicated grid patterns (like the tiling on the sides of pools). When the servo moves the camera up or down the image can sometimes become too complicated for it to process and it has issues.Maybe try running some tests with different backgrounds and see if it still freezes.  If it does still freeze, it could be a issue with the wire connecting to the Beaglebone.The white wire that connects the camera to the Beaglebone has had issues that cause the signal to drop out. If the camera continues to freeze in the above situation you can run a test on the wire. If you remove the camera from the rest of the ROV and then plug it into your laptop you should be able to view the image with a standard webcam viewer. If you play around with the wire see if the video cuts out. If it does cut out then it is more than likely this connecting wire.If the camera works without issues on a computer, than maybe your connection between the camera and the cable was loose and was simply needing to be connected better.Hopefully some of this info will help out.

Iâ€™m able to re-produce easily in a dark room while my ROV boots up, when Iâ€™m not connected it starts flashing the leds.  In this low-light situation the flashing causes the camera to kernel panic.  When Iâ€™m on the water in the daytime the camera works much better however it usually kernel panics the same way when I attempt to adjust the camera tilt. In every case, rebooting is the only way Iâ€™ve found to reset the camera.  Iâ€™m still trying to figure out if there is a camera configuration setting that might lessen the frequency of these kernel panics.  This seemed to happen less frequently but in a similar way on the previous version of 2.8 which had the wheezy kernel.  (As opposed to this new jessie kernel).Edit: It does seem that with *just the kernel panic sometimes itâ€™s possible to stop and start the cockpit software from the management page and the camera comes back.

We are doing the final testing for this release now, which is going well.In the mean time, I would like to offer a potential workaround for those of you experiencing the issue:The underlying cause of this issue is that the app is not properly displaying the feedback that the vehicle is sending it about the firmware upgrade. When you see the â€œChecking the ROVâ€™s Internet Connectionâ€ screen, it is very likely that the vehicle actually IS performing the upgrade underneath the hood, itâ€™s just that the app isnâ€™t properly showing that. One thing that you can try to do is this:Itâ€™s kind of a guessing game, since there is no feedback, so you may have to try a couple of times.If this doesnâ€™t work for you, please just hang tight, the new release will be available soon!",,,,,,i.mckernan,"Same problem here.

I am having the same problem as others and am hoping I can get the Trident working this weekend.The only way I have been able to successfully connect and control the Trident at this point is to open the cockpit app while connected to the internet and login to my account. I can then control remotely.One piece of this upgrade that Iâ€™m confused by is how the Trident is getting online in the first place? Does it connect directly from itâ€™s wifi topside unit to my internet router or does it go from the topside to my tablet and then online?  I was also thinking that I should be using my phone to do the upgrade so I could connect to the Trident via wifi and then still have mobile data to get online.Thank you,,,,,,charlesdc,"Hi all,The new version of the app is live now: 1.4.1.

They were supposed to be moved to the â€œExperimental Modeâ€, which you can unlock by going to Settings, then tapping â€œSETTINGSâ€ in the menu title 10 times very fast. Once you unlock the Experimental Options, go into that submenu and click â€œDeveloper Modeâ€. The password for this mode is â€œOpenAdventureâ€. After unlocking developer mode, go to the â€œControls Menuâ€ and the power level adjustments will be at the very bottom.Sorry for the confusion. Iâ€™ll make sure that the power level options get added to the proper menu without so much hidden-option-menu fuss in the next release.Also, I strongly advise against modifying any of the settings in the Developer Options menu. Changing anything in here will either do nothing or adversely affect your system, as they are designed for specific tests we are doing in-house.The â€œExperimentsâ€ menu is ok to use, but be aware that the two options in there are not officially supported (1080p and telemetry recording).",,,,,,Peter_S,Will there also be a button for taking photos?

The little arrow for exampleâ€¦ How do you best use it in order to know where you are/what direction youâ€™re travelling?I guess I might figure it out eventually but for now Iâ€™m more focused on what I see and piloting the ROV and so I havenâ€™t really been using it to itâ€™s full advantage (I suspect).,,,,,,c.causetout,"The ring is actually jut a compass and the little arrow is the tridentâ€™s current  heading. At 0Â° it heads north, 90Â° it heads east, 180Â° south etcâ€¦<br>You may want to  have a second compass at hand to know where north is so you can have a better idea in what direction youâ€™re looking at the surface and then determine the Tridentâ€™s orientation.",,,,,,andreas_lindberg,"Thanks! I guess thatâ€™s what I figured. Just been to busy focusing on learning the controls to confirm it.<br>Having an extra compass on shore is a great idea!",,,,,,boatsd,"When you turn it on, have the ROV pointed north and it will be true to a compass.",,,,,,Ted,"If you hold the tether taught and go full thrust for a moment, you should be able to examine the heading, then do a three point turn, backing up to slack the line, and head back to the operator by going 180 degrees from previous heading.  Thanks boatsd for the calibration tipâ€¦",,,,,,andreas_lindberg,Doesnâ€™t it auto calibrate?,,,,,,balder.matt,I thought the big arrow was Tridents heading and small arrow was the direction your control device was pointing.,,,,,,marcolinger,"To say it in other words : when you start the Trident, the direction his nose is heading is considered as north. I think the best way is not to consider the real coordinates but to place the Trident with his nose looking in the direction you will navigate then start it. By doing this if you always know where you are and which heading you have to take to come back to the strand, maybe more right or left but nevertheless to the strand.",,,,,,c.causetout,"Really?. Gotta check.<br>I had the impression that it actually gave true magnetic north no matter how it was oriented on powering up.",,,,,,balder.matt,"I am in agreement with that. The compass on board Trident gives true magnetic. The small compass arrow on the cockpit screen is your controller (tablet, phone) orientation and for me the top of my tablet is the north.What would be GREAT is if there was a way to see the part of the Trident theater that is floating on the surface along with the controller device GPS location plotting on a map. This is similar to navigation aids on aerial drones. I believe that the FiFish P3 has this feature from what I have seen in reviews and looks to be a great navigation aid.",,,,,,marcolinger,Strange â€¦ In cockpit view I have only one arrow !,,,,,,c.causetout,"I second marcolinger. One arrow only in my cockpit view.<br>I checked what was written above and do confirm that this arrow actually just points straight ahead on powering up the trident. It is not true magnetical north.<br>This actually easily allows for different navigational uses, so it is a good thing!",,,,,,andreas_lindberg,"I have two arrowsâ€¦ One showing the direction I (the tablet) am facing and one showing where the Trident is facing.<br>Different software versions?",,,,,,Eric_Stackpole,"Hey all! If the device youâ€™re using has a built in compass (tablets as well as the Trident controller donâ€™t but phones often do) then an additional arrow will show up that indicates the direction that device is pointing for reference. For devices without an internal compass, the reference arrow wonâ€™t appear. The larger vehicle arrow for Trident is linked to a magnetometer on-board the vehicle that detects magnetic north and also fuses that data with a rate gyro. In order for this system to work well, the vehicle usually needs to be calibrated. To do this, I recommend (before starting your dive) rotating the vehicle back and forth about each of its three axis several times. This will allow the magnetometer to detect where north is and ignore other magnificent fields. Weâ€™re still catching up on documentation, but we hope to have a tutorial for all this stuff sometime soon. Thank you everyone for helping each-other get this stuff figured out in the meantime!",,,,,,andreas_lindberg,"Thanks for clearing that up Eric!<br>Apparently I have a built in compass in my Sony tabletâ€¦ Who knew!",,,,,,oddgeir,"I realy appreciate your comment Eric. On my dive today, I used your instructions, and were finally able to use the direction arrow the correct way.If you or someone else from openrov, could send out a qick draft of a user manual for the Trident app, I think it would benefit all of us in the long run. With better knowledge about how it is supposed to work, it is easier to give correct feedback regarding improvements.With that said, you guys (and girls) have made an excellent ROV for the consumer market <img  title="":blush:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":blush:"">",,,,,,marcolinger,I totally agree with oddgeir !It would also be interesting to have one common adress where early users could send their recommendations for new users. I mean this type of remarks :,,,,,,filippo.f3rrario,"Thanks for the info.<br>I recently had the chance to test the TRIDENT at sea for the first time in a proper way. Reading this tread of posts I understood that the Trident need to be calibrated before a dive. I did spin the rov around the 3 axes and the heading I read on the singularity pad seems to agree with analogical compass directions. However I noticed that as soon as I put the rov in the water and I start diving the heading readings become unreliable.After some trials I had the impression that when the trident change inclination, mainly up and down, the heading is altered even if i did not change the direction compared to the north. This basically happen almost all the time since I frequently need to adjust the pitch (up and down) even when moving left and right.Today I tested it again and what I noticed is that, even if calibrated, at some point the reading on the compass go off. However when I retrieved it was still point north correctly.<br>If I do not calibrate it, as someone was proposing here, the heading go off pretty soon.The consequence is that I canâ€™t really figure out where Iâ€™m going and I end up doing random dives.Is this a problem just of my unit or Itâ€™s me doing something wrong?<br>Any fix?Thank you very much.",,,,,,TCIII,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/filippo.f3rrario"">@filippo.f3rrario</a>,I suspect that the magnetic fields generated by the Tridentâ€™s thruster motors are influencing the compass on the Trident especially the magnetic field of the vertical thruster. I have seen the same thing happen with the compass in the IMU module on my OROV2.8.This peculiarity has been discussed to some extent about the IMU module that is available for the OROV2.x. The understanding was that when the thrusters are operational the IMU module will use the gyro/accels for heading and then revert back to the compass when the thrusters are off and no magnetic fields are being generated by the thruster motors.Regards,<br>TCIII AVD"Trident connector to 2.X series Mod,https://forum.openrov.com/t/trident-connector-to-2-x-series-mod/6544,OpenROV 2.5 -

Diving in salt water, I have been able to go 10-15m, sometimes shorter, before I completely lose control and lose the video stream to my phone. In some cases the green light indicator on the check mark on the topside was out, while the other lights remained on.Issues havenâ€™t been very easy to reproduce on dry land, so it almost seems like water is a factor.The 25m tether still works fine every time, both in and out of water.Iâ€™d be grateful for any suggestions.",,,,,,marcolinger,"Hello, until now my Trident has only been in salted water, always 100m, and I never had a problem. You should check if the connection at Trident level is good. Have you after each dive cleaned the connector with clear water ?

I changed to the 25m tether that Iâ€™ve used before, and that worked fine!",,,,,,cmcp,"Hello, have you tried reversing the direction of the cable so that the opposite end connects to the Trident?

Iâ€™ll see about reversing the tether! Iâ€™ve actually already got feedback from support that I can return the tether for repairs, but Iâ€™m at a remote location now that has been the main location Iâ€™ve been aiming to dive, and I wonâ€™t get another chance to dive here before next year. Itâ€™d be really good to get a few hours flight time here with the longer tether if I can get it working at all. So far Iâ€™ve only been able to dive to 2-3 meters though, so Iâ€™m not really convinced the pressure is an issue. Itâ€™s certainly worth a shot, though!!",,,,,,ketil1,"So I reversed the tether and went out for a dive. My recording of the dive was about 1 minute long before the video stalled and I experienced total lack of control again. I hadnâ€™t even started aiming for any depth, I was just keeping the trident below the surface.Itâ€™s odd that the video and controls seem to work smooth on the surface the 100m tether, and that my 25m tether works fine both in and out of water, but both ends of my 100m tether seem to have trouble. Iâ€™m not pulling much tether off the spool, so maybe 90-95 meters of the cable has been untouched on each dive, and now Iâ€™ve had the same issue with both ends. I think thereâ€™s something I donâ€™t get about how this cable works.By the way, I used the 100m tether as I was rinsing the trident in fresh water as well. I dunked the trident in a bucket of fresh water and ran the motors, first front down for the center motor, and then rear down for the other two motors (nice that it <em>just</em> fits into a bucket). The trident was on for at least 5 minutes in wet conditions, connected to the 100m tether, without any issues at all. This was immediately after the dive in salt water.",,,,,,ketil1,"Iâ€™ve been looking at this some more, and Iâ€™ve tried to see any differences on the connectors for the 25m and 100m tether. I counted how many half-turns I rotate the thumb screw to attach the tether, and it seems around 7 half turns is enough to tighten the connector, this goes for both tethers, and also counts for both the topside and the trident itself.I had a closer look at the connector itself, and the connectors appear to be two pieces glued together. Could there be a leak in the actual connector?? If so Iâ€™m very unfortunate, because there must be a leak in both connectors on the 100m tether. Seems unlikely. But the connector on my 25m tether looks â€œcleanerâ€. Here are a few pictures.

Thatâ€™s not to say that you donâ€™t have faulty mouldings. You may want to closely examine the mating faces of the connector, particularly the circular surrounds to the gold coloured contacts. Unlike salt water, fresh water is not a particularly good conductor of electricity; this would possibly explain why your bucket test did not reveal a fault - you could try filling your bucket with sea water and repeat the test. The salt water may be allowing a track between contact points if the seating is compromised.Other possibilities include a structural defect within the tether or other interference such as an induction problem; you may like to consider unwinding more, if not all, of the tether and try another salt water dive. Your posts suggest that the problem may have escalated from appearing at 10-15 metres depth to just below the surface, in which case it may be time to accept that the tether has to be returned for repair/replacement.

I would recommend a pure sine wave inverter, just in case and for longevity.The charger has a universal input at 120 or 240 VAC, refer to the specs.  I would not recommend going direct DC for charging, Lithium batteries can be fickle and not using the supplied charger is a recipe for disaster.Using a 100 Watt solar panel charging a battery (your inverter attached to the battery) assuming optimal solar conditions it should be more than enough to charge the 95 Wh capacity battery (refer to the specs).",,,,,,pforperry,"I am also very interested in charging Trident from a nominal 12v supply and suspect there will soon be a way to achieve this.I have recently purchased a programmable dc-dc battery charger (<a href=""http://www.master-instruments.com.au/products/63158/CH-TSB003PCBR5.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.master-instruments.com.au/products/63158/CH-TSB003PCBR5.html</a>) for a related project that uses batteries similar to Trident and suspect this charger could also be programmed to suit Trident.I have easy access to mains power for the time being however I plan to charge Trident from a remote power supply including from solar and other supplies.",,,,,,ketil1,Options for charging in a car would also be good.

Hit the intents button on your phone, this is the multi window looking one on my galaxy. the upper right, select lock apps and youâ€™ll notice the split screen button appear on the individual app windows. hit that, and select the app for the split screen you want.Fire up the trident and connect to the kit with each app.You did it. Split cockpit feed for you VR lenses to focus on.Next post, Iâ€™ll let you know how to get the cheapo controller to work.",,,,,,Jim_N,"Some of you might be asking yourself, so what? Well, friends, the sun is bright. So your phone or tablet will be rough to use, even on the brightest setting. Though, I must admit, the controller that OpenROV is selling for the Trident is great. But, remember, Iâ€™m cheap, so instead of dishing out $400 and still deal with the sun, Iâ€™d rather spend $30 and have a screen in my face with little to no interference from our grand provider of all things, Sol.(Iâ€™m gonna get a controller in the future though, anyway, cuz they are sweet) Moving on, Iâ€™m not having much luck with this shitty little bluetooth controller that comes with this headset, so might just pick up a better one tomorrow.To all the trident beta cats, how are you set up from topside ROV stations? Iâ€™d like to get a survey going to see how all you are doing it.",,,,,,Jim_N,"The cheapo thumb controller wouldnâ€™t cut the mustard. So I went out and got a proper evo vr games pad for 20 bucks.

I have been interested in the HD Pro Camera upgrade for the OpenROV 2.8 but it has been unavailable for some time now. While I wait for my Trident I would like to complete the upgrade of my 2.8 to the new camera.On the forums I have seen the added functionality that was provided for the HD Pro camera upgrade but unfortunately the same developments for the standard camera have been rather stagnated.Can you share the model of the camera that you are using for the 2.8 and the Trident and a possible third party source of the USB module?I can make the required PCB to house the new camera in my mini-mill that I use to make PCBs so I only need the camera module.From what I can find online it seems that the Pro upgrade camera is the same camera used in the Amazon Web Services  â€œDeeplensâ€ AI developers kit which uses a GEO Semiconductor imager with H.264 builtin compression. Looking at the different imagers available at GEO it looks like the GC6500 may be the underlying imager that is being used.Can you elaborate on what camera is being used in the hopes that I and others can obtain the camera from another source since the OpenROV store seems to not stock the camera any longer?,,,,,,liquidus99,"Has anyone successfully used the<a href=""https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/electronics/cam-usb-low-light-r1/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">BlueROV Low Light HD Camera</a> in the OpenROV 2.8 or earlier?If so, what was involved besides the required physical modifications to mount the camera?

Iâ€™ve been thinking of setting up a projector screen on the dock in Monterey at night to let people walking by see what Iâ€™m looking at. Google Home with a Chromecast works well, but there are other options too.FYI, if you have OpenROV Cockpit installed on multiple devices, they can all view (and control) the Trident stream at the same time. You shouldnâ€™t add too many devices as each one you add uses a bit more on board resources, but weâ€™ve often had a pilot on his or her own controller and a bunch of onlookers looking at a different tablet connected with Cockpit. Itâ€™s also super fun when you have multiple people who want to fly and each person with a device can take turns flying vs watching.Please send photos of showing off what youâ€™re doing to crowds. Itâ€™s great to see that stuff!Eric",,,,,,Alexander_Havens,"Iâ€™m interested in this as well, but also in taking what you were talking about, Eric (two or more devices having control), a bit further. At my facility, I am looking into running an ROV with a group, but the area we can launch the ROV from is across the building from the area I would likely have them gathered (the â€œcontrol van,â€ if you will). Is there any way to control the Trident over a local wifi network, or perhaps simply a good way to screenshare control of the vehicle from a local device to a remote one via a wifi network?",,,,,,ketil1,"The ability to stream video to two devices at the same time at least solves the issue of using one phone for the controls, and one in a VR/Google cardboard setup.I havenâ€™t found a solution yet, but Iâ€™m poking around to see if thereâ€™s a combination available of screen pinning together with a disabled touch screen (eg disable all input except screen unpinning, which requires a code).

We do float labs and have a classroom element as well.  Iâ€™m thinking of using the class time to orient the kids to the controls and then giving them turns running a transect in the VR glasses.  There are laptops set up in the galley which would be a great place to view the live stream but also would induce seasickness.  The VR glasses can cause seasickness as well but they wonâ€™t be in them that long.  You really need a daylight display or glasses to get the wow factor for the kids.  A sun washed screen just doesnâ€™t show detail, especially in murky water.  I have done two of these trips now with kids and every time I get at least one wow, usually a few wows in a row, when they put on the glasses.  Iâ€™m hoping we can come up with a few vr headsets. With that in mind I think we will use the time on the water to take turns getting video and then review the video back at the docks while we process other collected data.  The glasses are better than virtual reality, itâ€™s real reality, and engages them on their level.  Add a 360 camera and vr glasses and you Might just blow their little heads off.  Iâ€™m putting an expedition together on Openrov.natgeo that will go into more detail and show the progress of the ROV element on the float labs.  Iâ€™ll post a link on this thread once it is approved and live.",,,,,,pforperry,"I will soon be installing a Teltonika RUT950 3G/4G router and high gain antenna on my boat to establish a reliable data connection to the internet.   I will also establish a similar ground based connection using a directional antenna for shore based deployments.Once I have established this reliable and relatively low latency connection I will be seeking to launch and operate Trident in a number of remote locations and then test the possibility of remote control of Trident by others.I have been led to believe this might be possible and a feature provided by future updates.   I have also been led to believe some additional hardware may be required.   In any case, remote control and live (or near real time) viewing of video by others that might not otherwise get to experience underwater exploration is a natural and exciting extension of Trident and the citizen science movement."Control via intetnet,https://forum.openrov.com/t/control-via-intetnet/6388,Trident,317,43250,3,Control via intetnet - Trident - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,cahilljoh,"Hi guys, I 'm just wondering, has anyone with a Trident tried to control it via the internet yet ?<br>I 'm hoping to try it when I get mine and would appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance.",,,,,,marcolinger,"I am not certain to understand what you would exactly like to do. You always need to have an android tablet at the place where your trident is diving. With a remote desktop tool, like Teamviewer you can access remotely via internet the android tablet to take control of your Trident. I honestly do not see in which case this could be usefull.<br>In case you mean by internet control the mean to control the Trident via an internet browser, this is not possible for the time being but may be implemented later.",,,,,,cahilljoh,"Hi Marc,Thanks very much for your advice, much appreciated. Sorry for not making my query clearer. What I was wondering was, if  and how it would possible for one person to place the Trident in the water, and then someone else controlled the Trident somewhere else via the internet using the cellular network. Drone enthusiasts use a programme such as â€œAndruavâ€ , and the underwater drone company â€œAquabotixâ€ claim that their drone can controlled via internet. I was wondering if any beta or early customers had tried this yet.Thanks again,John Cahill",,,,,,pforperry,I am also very interested in remote access and control of Trident and I have this at the top of my list of things to do after finishing the payload modules.I have been led to believe there are likely to be some latency type issues to overcome before remote access and control is smooth enough for mainstream use.

However, thatâ€™s winter time here in Norway, so the conditions can be freezing. Can I hack a hole in the ice and dive with the Trident in these conditions? I think my main concern would be when I lift the ROV up out of the cold (but warmer than freezing) water into freezing air. Water in any small cracks or crevices will freeze and expand, with enough force to crack rocks.So my question is, should I keep the dives to â€œwarmerâ€ days, eg warmer than freezing? Or can I venture out into the freezing cold without worries?",,,,,,Eric_Stackpole,"Hi ketil1!Trident is certainly being designed for under-ice diving. In fact, the concept for Trident initially came together durring an expedition in Antarctica where we were deploying a (much more expensive) ROV under the sea ice in the Ross Sea. Tridents dimension should allow it to fit down a standard 10"" (250mm) Jiffy Ice Drill hole.All that being said, I should be careful to mention that we havenâ€™t yet done empirical testing of Trident in extreme cold conditions. Weâ€™ll learn a lot more about how freezing conditions (and other environments) affect the vehicle after weâ€™ve done more field testing, and weâ€™ll try to publish best practices guidelines once we have that info.Great question- it will be fun to see Trident being used in such interesting places!",,,,,,ketil1,"Thanks for the response! I look forward to getting more info on this, but Iâ€™ll probably try to keep my dives to days that arenâ€™t super cold before we know more.Winter water is much clearer (in many places, anyway), so from that perspective the cold should make for superior exploration conditions! For example, a small bay I often visit during summers is mostly 70-100m deep, and has a 40m deep plateau somewhere out there. Locals tell me that they can see the 40m deep plateau from boats in the winter. In the summer, itâ€™s all just darkness when looking from the surface. <img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:"">",,,,,,Aidan_Karley,"Is it possible to have a waterproof box on site when you retrieve te ROV. ROV into box ; pour buckets of water from ice-hole into box, with some salt (or other freezing supressant) until ROV covered in water ; lid onto box ; pack up and leave site. At base / workshop you can unpack the kit in (relative) warmth.<br>By the time youâ€™ve got the lid on the box, it will take much longer for the whole box to freeze. Even just keeping the wind off it will improve matters a lot.<br>Plan B - if you havenâ€™t got time / weight for plan A might be to have a large waterproof bag to put the ROV into, then add an anti-freeze to the bag which isnâ€™t an environmental poison (alcohol from camping stove, for e.g.). Pack up and get to somewhere (relatively) warm. But youâ€™d have to check the compatibility of the anti-freeze with o-rings, lube, etc.<br>I was talking to a man from Poseidon (diving regulator manufacturer) who recommended â€œwinterisingâ€ their demand valves by filling with Malt Scots Whiskey - doesnâ€™t freeze (well, to ~ -60C) and doesnâ€™t damage <em>their</em> o-rings or lube. So stove alcohol is probably a good (cheap) start point.I dive the great lakes with some frequency. Most of the precautions we take have to do with valves freezing which wonâ€™t matter here.

Other causes can be very unbalanced drag and ESCs losing their programming. Hereâ€™s a little bit of info that might help get folks on the right path:if itâ€™s still pulling left or right, check that both motors turn relatively freely by hand. They can be a little different from each-other but major differences could indicate a physical problem.In the settings or diagnostics pane there is a motor slider, you can enter a value and see if that in both the port and starboard motors and check how it flies from there.If these are not working it could be the motor or the esc (hard to tell). Letâ€™s try reflashing the esc.////<br>The ESCâ€™s (electronic speed controllers) donâ€™t share the same firmware as the Arduino on the Controller board.<br>In order to flash your ESCâ€™s manually, follow these instructions:Download PuTTY. It is a program that allows you to manually connect to an IP address via a terminal window.<br>When you run the program, connect to the IP address: 192.168.254.1<br>If there is no connectivity issues due to hardware, or your computers static IP address, it should open a terminal window.Type in the following lines of code:cd /opt/openrov/cockpit/linuxsudo bash install-afro-esc-firmware.shpower cycle the ROV and see if that does anything<br>////just to make sure itâ€™s not drag or some other cause, you can move the left motor to the right and conversely. Fly it forward using the W key (not a gamepad) at low or medium thrust factor. That will rule out any hydrodynamic issues. Youâ€™ll have to swap them back (donâ€™t do any soldering or disconnecting of wire just yet) so you donâ€™t have reversed controls left and right.Itâ€™s probably the motor.

Will try the short tether first though as is simpler and should have less drag / weight distribution issues to deal withâ€¦i think?Deeper water and most research applications would mean acoustic positioning gear though.Much to play with and try out with this beast. <img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:"">",,,,,,HR1,"It wonâ€™t be able to do a decent (accurate) grid out of the box, but use of the buoy to refresh an IMU would make it capable of very accurate grids.Another option would be a downward looking camera and assuming the bottom could be resolved, it could use an image correlation system to determine itâ€™s position with respect to the bottom.",,,,,,Scott_W,"Hi Ian <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/i.mckernan"">@i.mckernan</a>Reading between the lines it sounds like you are doing some <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/structure-from-motion-for-documenting-for-citizen-community-science-and-marine-archaeology/2554"">Structure from Motion mapping</a> of shallow water sitesBig picture the SfM software is pretty good and you donâ€™t need the GPS location of the camera as a first off location for the software to work out the camera pose as software can work it out by pure computer grunt power (albeit a fair amount of time). Additionally as long as you get a good amount of over coverage of the area the lines donâ€™t have to be straight and you will still get an output.Given what you are suggesting with the shortened tether (a great idea) you should also be able to upload the track file and then imply a image location (if you can time sync the two sets of data somehow) which (I canâ€™t remember the correct <a href=""http://www.agisoft.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Agisoft</a> terminology) should allow for an â€œadjacent pair selection type camera locationâ€ to be used to shorten the processing timeAbove and beyond this if you can drop a say 3 or 4 known ground control points (say different coloured weighted objects at known locations) you should be able to add this into the SfM model (not sure of the accuracy you are chasing but the assumption is that you are only after OK accuracy but not too tight as the GPS would only be Â±2.5m with a 95% confidence unless you go survey grade units) to geo-reference the model.In the future a plug in to interface the Tridents WiFi to the <a href=""https://github.com/KonradIT/goprowifihack"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">GoPro WiFi</a> and then trigger the frames and record the location (or add it into the image data file via <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Exif</a>) would be nice<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/hr1"">@HR1</a>In relationAnother option would be a downward looking camera and assuming the bottom could be resolved, it could use an image correlation system to determine itâ€™s position with respect to the bottom.The Laser realtime Distance Measurement plugin  that <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/joakim_karlsson"">@Joakim_Karlsson</a> had working a while back would pretty much do this without significant modification (hence GPS (sort of X and Y location and Z being set off the bottom via the laser distance plug in)Scott",,,,,,pforperry,"I am also interested in semi-autonomous control, line surveys and structure from motion using Trident.I sigh when I see the cost of underwater navigation systems and locators like the Water Linked Underwater GPS system stocked by Blue Robotics (<a href=""https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/electronics/underwater-gps/aps-wl-11001/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://www.bluerobotics.com/store/electronics/underwater-gps/aps-wl-11001/</a>).

My dive buddies and I wish to use the ROV to assist us in exploring areas offshore the South Florida area.  We are avid technical divers trained by the Global Underwater Explorers and believe it or not, very little true exploration is currently done in the areas that we frequent.  Most divers, technical divers included, dive the same thing time after time and do not engage in real exploration in the ocean.  We are bored with the same old dive sites and wish to shift our efforts into actual exploration.  We have a boat with 3d sonar that we will use to scout for interesting bottom features, once we identify spots of interest we wish to deploy your ROV to see it before we dive it to see if itâ€™s worth diving.  This will allow us to cover way more ground than simply diving it outright.  As an example, if we dive a 200 foot dive our bottom time would be limited to about 20 minutes, with upwards of 60 minutes of decompression to follow.  Not only is this time consuming, but it also costs close to $200 per diver to do this type of exploration in the 200 foot range.  Needless to say, we are excited for the ROV <img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:"">  My questions are as follows:Do you have a tether that is neutrally buoyant in salt water or if not, how does the ROV with the tether handle in salt water?What is the best controller to use to control the ROV and what software would you run to do so?  I assume a laptop is best to interface it with, but what are your suggestions?  I have an iPad as well as a MacBook Pro and we are looking for the most precise control possible of the ROV.Have you had a chance to test this in a high current area?  I see videos where the ROV does great in near static current conditions, but we will be deploying it in areas that sometime have rather swift currents.Looking forward to your responses and to receiving the ROV of course <img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:"">Thanks!Matt Cain",,,,,,onerealtyfl,I have another question!

This will have minimal effect on vehicle performance. If you look at the second half of this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bChRmaWJ8EU&amp;t=18s"">video</a> it shows the third person view of the vehicle in the water and you can see how the tether handles. This was filmed in Hawaii in salt water.The control device is kind of up to the users personal preference. As <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/brendan"">@Brendan</a> mentioned a screen that works will in daylight is definitely a plus. Tablets normally have brighter screens than laptops, but we use both here at the lab. As we get more of these in the field and run user testing we will be able to give some better recommendations.We have tested in a few high current situations. Since the vehicle is very hydrodynamic it handles going into the current well. Shooting video where you can see the performance is a little more challenging. The San Francisco area of the Pacific Ocean is where we test, but visibility is not great so shooting third person is hard. As a diver myself my opinion is that it would be able to handle any current that I as a diver would be comfortable getting into.The video recording is onto whatever the control device is (laptop, tablet, phone, etc.). We are looking at tapping into the GPS information on phones and tablets to embed this GPS information into the video. More on this to come closer to the release date.Let us know if you have additional questions, and I canâ€™t wait to see what you explore with the vehicle!",,,,,,onerealtyfl,"Thanks for the reply Brian!  One note on the GPS feature that I, and many others Iâ€™m sure, would love to see.  If you put a GPS on the float itself that would at least get you in the ballpark of where you need to be to find the same location again in the future. Is it perfect, no, but itâ€™s better than nothing, especially if it recorded the video with the gps coordinates of the float always available, along with the depth info of course.  I have spoken to other engineers about more accurate ways to determine GPS coordinates of the ROV itself.  The best answer Iâ€™ve head so far is you would have to develop a tether that is retractable and as it is let out, it keeps a slight tension on the line to keep it almost straight, it would also have to be able to measure how much line is out and somehow figure out the angle, with all that info you should be able to get the coordinates of the ROV on the bottom.

The unit is turned on by connection of the tether (I am assuming topside connection to the WiFi unit is good enough) thus if at sea on a small wet boat you can have the tether pre connected to the ROV and then make (and break as required for prolonged battery use) this topside tether connection - Is this correct?Do you have any power usage of the â€œsleepâ€ mode of the unit (so if it is connected up before heading out to sea) how long does it take for the WiFi unit and the Raspberry Pi on board the ROV (no active operation of the ROV) to run the battery down? eg if connected up in the morning on land given about 3-4 hrs of semi active normal use if it is used intermittently over say a 12hr day this may be 2-3hrs??Thanks Scott,,,,,,95345256,"I understand the buoy is also with the battery, right?

Thanks!",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/jlewallen18"">@jlewallen18</a>:You can definitely hook up a payload with a UART interface to your OpenROV, but its going to take a little bit of work on your part.The first thing you should do is grab a schematic for the controller board of your OpenROV.  You can find them on our Github site <a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-electronics"">here</a>.There are six auxiliary wires that come out of the OpenROV housing that can be used for whatever you want.  Note that on the OpenROV 2.8, five of those wires are pre-wired for lights and an external servo, so to use them for a UART you will have to break the existing connection to free up those wires.  Assuming you have a model 2.8, I would re-purpose the external servo wires (TP23-TP25) into a UART connection.  If you look at Sheet 2 of the schematic, I would remove R70 and R71, freeing up auxiliary wires TP23 and TP24 for the transmit and receive lines.  TP25 can be left as a ground signal.Then on your controller board youâ€™re going to have to run wires from the test pads TP23 and TP24 over to a free UART port on the microcontroller.   The microcontroller on the controller board is a ATMega 2560, the same as is used on the Arduino Mega.  If you study the free microcontroller I/O that is brought to the header sockets (Sheet 2 again), and cross them against the I/O of an Arduino Mega, you will see that there are a number of UARTs free for the end-user.  Note that the AtMega serial ports run at a 5V level.  If your device is 3.3V or true RS-232 (12V I thinkâ€¦) then you will have level-shift the signals appropriately.This leaves writing the software to get your telemetry topside.

As I have studied further some of the questions I originally had have been answered fully, or partially.  I am reaching that knowledge â€œtipping pointâ€ where I am starting to get a pretty solid big picture.None of the existing ROV packages out there fit my needs, or they cost as much as my house (so again, not fitting my needs lol).  The Trident comes very close, but not available yet, and still not â€œperfect.â€I want to go with the OpenROV platform though for the most important thing appears to be covered.  I need the ability to build my own basestation, or use just about any available platform.  So I am thinking to put together my own kit using the 2.8 developers kit.  When I priced everything out individually, you basically get a free tether!  I will likely go with a neutrally buoyant tether, but the dev kit one will at least get me online.I have a handful of questions though!I need a wireless buoy.  (At least I think I do!)  I will be using an HD camera setup, either the Pro Upgrade and chassis, or the Blue Robotics camera.  I wonâ€™t go into more details on the BR stuff, but have seen that I am not alone in a hybrid build.  Simply put for my needs, their enclosures are more configurable.  Otherwise, I am preferring the simpler nature of the OpenROV stuff, and the MUCH better documentation.  Anyways, the first question:Can a 2.4g wireless connection even reliably support the higher HD video data stream?  Obviously we are out of the water at this point.Is there a Tenda wireless adapter that can be used on the topside?I read the wireless buoy tutorial, but it seems that there has to be a cleaner way to build itâ€¦  I canâ€™t fully wrap my head around this.  Now if I could power the topside buoy through the tether from the ROV main battery, using a setup otherwise like the tutorial would make a little more sense.I need a different main chassis configuration.  I tempt fate here as I am sure it will take me some effort to get my design balanced.  The sides will have a tie fighter like look, like the Shark Marineâ€™s Stealth 2 visible here:<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/b/bd97f83ef624ef830db3ed2f22b01c7b9ded7362.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/bd97f83ef624ef830db3ed2f22b01c7b9ded7362"" title=""img_0016.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  alt=""img_0016"" width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">img_0016.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">788x591 127 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div>My main concern is that ideally I (think I) want 2 vertical thrusters and the 2 horizontal thrusters. It appears the controller board has outputs for 6 various servo or esc based devices.  I am just unsure how one goes about applying those.  Is the interface similar to say Open Pilot (well actually now Libre Pilot), or Betaflight for air based UAVâ€™s?How does the controller function, would a fourth ESC be added in parallel to the vertical thruster esc?Can I order additional ESCs from you guys?  Or better yet, can I order the controller board without escâ€™s and use my own?Would the software image need to be changed to function with a 4th thruster?  Or again, is this handled via a interface like Open Pilotâ€¦.  ???  Also how does it handle more thrusters, say 6 like some other platforms use?  Documentation claims control up to six thrusters, but a glance at the pictures only showed obvious spots for the 3â€¦Can I order the scaling laser diodes separately?  Or get a digikey part number?  I may not be using the OpenROV camera module as I really want the ability to upgrade the camera, and possibly record video onboard.Final question, for now!I have a Saitek Cyborg 3 that i purchased as soon as I saw it the other day, just for this project!  Hopefully it can be utilizedâ€¦My apologies as I am SURE lots of these questions are covered in various places in the different guides.  I have seen a few of my questions kinda touched on as I research them (and in fact did find and answer a few I deleted).I will try to wait patiently for answers lol!  I am waiting on some of these to decide on final parts to order.  It would be cheaper to buy a full kit, but I want the flexibility of a slightly different configuration, as mentioned first thing above.I do have an extensive background in arial drones and electronics.  But this is new territory and as such the information out there (in general) is pretty scarce.  Thank you guys in advance for your help!",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/biggs_darklighter"">@Biggs_Darklighter</a>:Here are some answers to your questions:1.) You can use WiFi, but typical WiFi implementations are not optimized for sending low-latency, interruption-free video.  The results you get will depend upon the amount of intereference in your area.  In general, prepare to be very disappointed with the performance of WiFi when used as communication to a buoy.For OpenROV Trident weâ€™ve spent a huge amount of time tweaking the code in the video pathway to achieve good, low-latency performance.2.) A couple of years ago we expermented with a Tenda WiFi homeplug unit for a topside.  We ended up not releasing a product at the time, as we were busy with other stuff.  But it would certainly be easy to experiment with at home.  The Tenda model number was PW201 and it is still in production, and seems to be available on E-bay, though it doesnâ€™t seem to be available on Amazon or major retailers.3.) It is pretty easy to add a fourth ESC to the current controller board.  If you search the forum archives youâ€™ll find a post that I did a couple years ago outlining the procedure.  If you are driving the two vertical ESCs with the same signal, you can do that without modifying code by just buying a â€œY-cableâ€ for the two vertical servos.4.) I donâ€™t believe we sell individual ESCs in the store, but the ESCs used on the controller board are available from HobbyKing. Youâ€™ll need to reprogram it from forwards-only (helicopter mode) to forward-reverse (car mode).  This has been discussed before on the forum.I donâ€™t think we sell controller boards without the ESCs.  There are just too few customers for such a product.5.) If youâ€™re not trying to do vertrans control (if youâ€™re running both vertical ESCs at the same speed), then you donâ€™t need any software changes for the 4th thruster- just use a Y-cable instead.  There was an experimental build a while ago for a 4-thruster vertrans configuration, but it hasnâ€™t been maintained in a while.6.) According to the OROV 2.8 bill-of-materials, <a href=""https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10005940/1453713-5mw-650nm-red-laser-diode-module-head-5-pack"">here</a> are the scaling lasers we use.  I donâ€™t know whether theyâ€™re in the store.  Have you looked?7.) Donâ€™t know.Hope this helps.  Keep us posted on how your build goes.-W",,,,,,Biggs_Darklighter,"Thank you Walt!The scaling lasers arenâ€™t in the store.  But those are cheap enough and easily obtained with that link, along with some other options too.I have ordered my developerâ€™s kit!  It seems that the wifi option isnâ€™t really worth bothering with for now.  I went with the full dev kit as there are some things I just donâ€™t know how to work with yet and it will get me everything to get connected and check out stuff like my joystick.  I think once I have the software and interface running, most of the remaining questions will quickly become clear.",,,,,,Jim_Scholz,"I used the dev kit with my first attempt at a build also.  I wanted a different configuration than the standard 2.8 design. I did have a leak issue with my end caps and am modifying the design to take a stepped end cap that will fit inside and over the end of the PVC housing. Here is a link to my initial design <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/rover-1-openrov-in-a-recycled-body/5263"">Rover 1 - OpenROV in a recycled body</a>",,,,,,Biggs_Darklighter,"Very creative!  I have thought of doing similar myself, but since photography is my first intent here, I decided to go with some more purpose made components to protect my gear.  If I put one of my proper cameras in this rig, that camera will easily eclipse the cost of the actual ROV build, by double or more.I was also a little leery of trusting the OpenROV DIY housing to pressure, waterproofness, and building mistakes.  Plus one drawback to the OpenROV style setup, shooting through a curved tube causes light refraction issues.  These are solved in the HD Camera setup with a special lense.  But I canâ€™t apply that lens to a M4/3rds format camera.  I go with this setup and I am limited to just using the OpenROV camera, no chance for upgrades.A domed end though solves this problem.  Blue Robotics sells (for a substantial price increase) tube, dome, and other components needed to make bodies like this.  The way they are made, already adds several layers of protection to the â€œonionâ€ and are similar techniques and construction used for camera dive cases.  And suddenly I can put any camera that I want (and can fit) into the tube.  An inexpensive option like a GoPro Hero Session becomes possible.Originally I planned to use the Pro-Upgrade.  But the more I looked at it, the smarter a custom setup became because of my primary focus.

Itâ€™s really interesting.Here is my understanding:For the original home plug unit:The power supply board collects 110 AC and step it down and rectify it into a 3.3V DC to supply power to the high-tech board. the J7 and J2 pins are the interface for RF communication.The 110 AC acts as a carrier wave which carries the RF signal generated by the high-tech board. I suppose the RF signal has a very different (higher) frequency than the 50Hz 110 AC.For the modified home plug with top side adapter in our ROV:The power of the high tech board comes from the top side adapterâ€™s mini USB port. roughly 5V DC.The 4.5V DC between the tether pins acts as a carrier wave (please verify my statement) carries the RF generated by the high-tech board to the ROV. The 4.5 V DC is also used to turn on the ROV.speaking of modulation, is this some kind of frequency modulation (FM)? but usually, in FM, there is a low frequency carrier wave and a signal wave (usually with much higher frequency) to be modulated. In this case, does the 4.5V DC really behave like a carrier?Please clarify my understanding!Many thanks!",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/sunjianxiao12.08"">@sunjianxiao12.08</a>:Your description is close.The communication protocol going over the tether (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePlug"">Homeplug AV</a>) does not need any particular voltage to serve as a â€œcarrierâ€.  It will work perfectly fine over a pair of wires that has no DC voltage on it.We take advantage of this to use DC voltage to signal whether the ROV should be turned on or not.  If there is more than ~3V DC on the tether, the ROV turns on.

Itâ€™s an eye opener for me!Just to quote from wiki:<br>â€œOFDM is a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme used as a digital multi-carrier modulation method. A large number of closely spaced orthogonal sub-carrier signals are used to carry data on several parallel data streams or channels. Each sub-carrier is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme (such as quadrature amplitude modulation or phase-shift keying) at a low symbol rate, maintaining total data rates similar to conventional single-carrier modulation schemes in the same bandwidth.â€<br>â€œIn OFDM, the subcarrier frequencies are chosen so that the subcarriers are orthogonal to each other, meaning that crosstalk between the subchannels is eliminated and intercarrier guard bands are not required. This greatly simplifies the design of both the transmitter and the receiver. In conventional FDM, a separate filter for each subchannel is required.â€now my only doubt is that for the original homeplug unit, the mains voltage is merely used to provide power to the homeplug board through a step down transformer and a AC to DC converter, it is not used as a carrier neither since the homeplug is able to generate sub-carriers.Thanks<br>SJX"Additional Pro Cameras?,https://forum.openrov.com/t/additional-pro-cameras/5802,OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8,515,Aug '17,6,Additional Pro Cameras? - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kent,Have just ordered an OpenROV 2.8 kit with some spare parts as well.

We powered the ROV down and re-seated the video cable (both ends) and the BeagleBone Black.  Upon reassembling the craft, we still did not have any video feed in the cockpit.  We attached the ROV to a windows machine and again tried the external lights and the video feed.  They are not working.  As we need to ship this puppy out next week, we need to fix it ASAP.  Any insight you can provide would be welcome.PS - How do you get the alt-i function to work on a mac?  That is the command in Chrome to turn on the external lights.  Yes, it didnâ€™t work on windows either for this ROV, but we just want to ensure we tell the Peruvian team the right key-combo to light the big lights.Thanks for your prompt replies.PS - we tried connecting the USB camera directly to our windows computer and were unable to get the operating system to see the camera.  Usually we can see the USB camera on our computer."OpenROV 2.7 Overview,https://forum.openrov.com/t/openrov-2-7-overview/2420,OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8,1.8k,Aug '17,2,OpenROV 2.7 Overview - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,David_Lang,"<span><a href=""http://store.openrov.com/collections/frontpage/products/openrov-v2-7-kit"" target=""_blank""><img width=""750""></a></span><span>Today we're releasing <a href=""http://store.openrov.com/collections/frontpage/products/openrov-v2-7-kit"" target=""_blank"">OpenROV v2.7</a>. It represents the latest in everything we've learned about building an affordable and capable underwater robot. Although the overall shape may seem similar to the previous version, almost every aspect of the ROV has been improved and upgraded. Our focus has been on increasing the usability and robustness of the vehicle, while keeping the price as accessible as possible. We're proud of what we've come up with.</span><span>From a performance perspective, the OpenROV v2.7 is the best ROV we've ever built. It streams HD video back to the surface laptop over an ultra-thin two-wire tether. It maneuvers using the same thruster configuration as previous models, however new hydrodynamic adjustments, new motors, and new motor speed controllers have resulted in greatly improved handling and control, especially in the vertical direction. A new LED board provides even more illumination in the depths, and the lasers provide both scaling and distance measurement capability.</span><span>You can learn more about the robot here: <a href=""http://store.openrov.com/collections/frontpage/products/openrov-v2-7-kit"">http://store.openrov.com/collections/frontpage/products/openrov-v2-7-kit</a></span><span>The hallmark of OpenROV has always been the community.

This is causing the vehicle to turn when it should be going straight.Thereâ€™s a check box in the software calibration for each motor that allows you to reverse itâ€™s rotation without rewiring the motor.  Just check that box for the motor thatâ€™s reversed and things should straighten out.-W",,,,,,eric5,"Thanks for the suggestion.  I took it out to test it in salt water today and had several problems with it.  First off the motors seemed to stop responding or failed to spin up when in the water.  If I lifted it out, the motors would spin and if I dropped it in the water it would keep spinning, however if I stopped the motors and tried to start them spinning again they often wouldnâ€™t start.They spin freely when off, so I donâ€™t know what is going on.  I put it back on the bench and they seem to be operating ok.  I tried recalibrating them again.  I found one motor would not not start up.  So if I did the ESC calibration (turn on only the one motor with button pressed to get the beeping, then press once and flip the setting to +1, press again, -1, wait) the starboard motor never starts spinning unlike the Port or vertical motors.When operating them on the bench the starboard motor emits a short beep sound too.Any more thoughts on where to go from here?"New OpenROV Pro camera on Raspberry Pi 3,https://forum.openrov.com/t/new-openrov-pro-camera-on-raspberry-pi-3/5273,OpenROV Product Support,775,Jul '17,2,New OpenROV Pro camera on Raspberry Pi 3 - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,QuiGon2,"Hi all!I am trying to setup the new Pro Camera in a Raspberry Pi 3, but i canâ€™t get it working.

I added ballast so the robot has a neutral buoyancy. I saw the depth control react towards the vertical axis motor so I prepared some cameraâ€™s.

But if your Aduino is connected to your computer directly, then are you opening the serial console inside the Arduino IDE to watch for data coming from it? Are you using a different serial terminal, like PuTTY?In order to help figure out why youâ€™re not seeing data from the Arduino, I think we need a lot more information.TB",,,,,,tcbetka,"Actually, looking at the code on the Github site, I think your ArduSlave::Initialize() method should be called in the setup() function in the OpenROV2x.ino sketch, as shown here.Then you could probably just call your ArduSlave::Update() function from inside the loop() functionâ€“or call it once inside setup() just to see that the code is working. But you still need to listen to the Arduinoâ€™s serial port though. But if you can see that test output from the OpenROV2x.ino setup() function, then your code should also cause a message to print across the same serial port interface.So getting this to work might be pretty simple for you. As it turns out, I donâ€™t think youâ€™ll need to instantiate an object of your ArduSlave class at allâ€“just call the methods using the fully-qualified name (class::method()) as Iâ€™ve mentioned in the first two paragraphs here.TB",,,,,,idsuhwan1,"<em>I changed like bellow.</em><br><em>Help me please.</em><em>------ArduSlave.h-----</em><br><em><span class=""hashtag"">#pragma</span>

Thereâ€™s no particular reason why the batteries wouldnâ€™t work today.  If you have a voltmeter, Iâ€™d just check the voltage of the individual cells- If theyâ€™re at full charge theyâ€™ll be around 3.4 volts or so.  Once theyâ€™ve discharged a bit, theyâ€™ll be around 3.2 volts each.The motherboard is designed to work with either LiFePO4 cells (3.2 volts nominal) or Li-NMC  cells (3.7 volts nominal) so that shouldnâ€™t be a problem.If the cells seem fine and youâ€™re still not getting power, Iâ€™d make sure that you have prepped the cells correctly- there should be something in the instructions about trimming off the insulation on the bottom of the cell, and perhaps putting a solder blob on the top of the cell.  This helps the cells to make contact when they are stacked- the cells are flat-top as opposed to the classic button-top variety, and sometimes need a little help in making contact with each other.-W",,,,,,rabphxaz,"hi walt,<br>just saw this email and since i couldnâ€™t respond to you on the forum, i<br>wrote another post to try to get my issue solved. but maybe replying to you<br>via email would be quicker.

A lot of hydrophones are tuned to capture &gt;20kHz, as a lot of marine animals communicate in frequency ranges that arenâ€™t audible by humans. Whales are below our range, dolphins are much higher. Human range is 20-20k Hz (roughly).So ultimately you would need to select a frequency range, transpose the audio to somewhere between 20-20k Hz (but probably more like 100-15k Hz)."IMU Calibration (compass and tilt),https://forum.openrov.com/t/imu-calibration-compass-and-tilt/824,Add-ons / Accessories,9.6k,May '17,47,IMU Calibration (compass and tilt) - Add-ons / Accessories - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,quantumquark,"I am confused as to how you are currently doing compass and tilt calibration.

Afterwards the compass value came up with a heading value of 0 +/-2 degrees. This is in the heading part of the telemetry data shown on rights side of ROVCockpit. The compass dial that is part of the HUD did not show correct unfortunately. This still showed East as heading. Even stranger was when I then rotated the ROV towards East, verified by compass, the ROV heading showed West! Still on telemetry data, the HUD compass is far out.Definitively a puzzle that needs solving!As far as the other vectors like tilt and roll, I would assume applying a similar offset value would work there as well. Have not tried to change this as the values are correct in my set up.The best would of course be if the calibration buttons in the ROV cockpit worked, but still this only handles 2 of the parameters, the rest still needs to be changed elsewhere.",,,,,,JYC,"I tested my IMU today, I'm having the same kind of issue than you.

If anyone wants to contribute code patches to help out with this, get yourself a GitHub account and start coding away!-W",,,,,,JYC,"Thanks for reply, I'll have a look if I can do something.

If there is some sort of short circuit in the ESCs or motors, when the ESCs are turned on (via mosfet Q2), the battery voltage will drop, the +5V supply will cut out, the Atmega 2560 will turn off, and Q2 will then turn back off, cutting off the short circuit.  The whole cycle then repeats itself over and over again.When you short across J17, the ESCs are powered on anytime system power is on.What  <em>might</em> have happened is that there was a stray bit of solder causing a short circuit in the one anomalous ESC.  When you jumpered J17 and turned the ROV on, high current from the battery eventually burned out that short circuit.

IIRC the kit comes with a spare laser- if you take it apart youâ€™ll probably find that its a small PC board floating inside the brass housing.  Iâ€™ve always wondered if things would be improved if that board was staked down inside the brass housing, rather than free-floating.  Itâ€™s an experiment that Iâ€™d like to do sometime, but unfortunately there are plenty of things in the queue ahead of this, both for Trident and for my homemade ROVs.Weâ€™ve started talking about a laser scaler option for Trident.  It will likely use a periscope optical design that guarantees the parallelism of the beams.  Unfortunately that will drive up the cost somewhat, but few good things in life come freeâ€¦-W",,,,,,geoffreyash,"Hm, so if I got the laser focused, and then filled the housing with a small<br>amount of epoxy or CA somehowâ€¦that might solve the issue.<br>Would that cause any other problem internally with the lasers?",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"I donâ€™t know what would happen if you got epoxy up onto the laser chip itself.

You might want to get a couple to experiment with, and try a couple different methods of epoxying to see what works best.-W",,,,,,Jim_Scholz,"Walt, As a suggestion for laser distance, why not use three lasers? Make the outside ones parallel for side to side measurements and a third laser mounted at a higher point between the two outside. At a preset distance, the three would be in a straight line. Shorter than the set distance the middle laser would be above the center line and further than the set point the middle one would be below the center line.  Pre-measuring the offset would let you calculate the distance.",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Jim:Interesting idea.  If you give it a try, let us know how well it works.Given the pace at which image processing and cameras are improving, I suspect that software plugins that do range measurement are going to work well.

Meaning-- number of packets received by Chrome and number dropped by Chrome.Iâ€™m deducing this (hopefully correctly) by noticing that the statistics on dropped packets are markedly improved when I navigate away from the cockpit (though it is still active in the background but not refreshing the screen at all-- then return to it. Dropped Frame rate does not increment.I checked my Rev of Chrome and Iâ€™m up to date.<br>I checked my system and have all current (Mac) OS and Drivers (including Graphics accelerator card).I note that I have a responsibly powerful machine-- 2.6GHz Intel Core 5 with 16 Gigs memory and and Intel Iris 1536 Graphics accelerator card, 500Gig Solid State Drive.As part of testing I changed the frame rates and the resolution and found no improvements in the dropped frame rate-- always hovering around 30-50%I next investigated ways to try and force the system to use the Graphics Accelerator Card. There is a Chrome Setting: Advanced Settings: System: Use Hardware Acceleration when available-- but this was already selected.Looking at the CPU monitor I found a process called: VTDecoderXPCService which was consuming most of my CPU cycles in in conjunction with Chrome and Chrome Helper.A google search revealed that the VTDecoderXPCService is a Sandboxing service in OSX.

Not sure how it will impact battery life etc.",,,,,,charlesdc,"Hi <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/rovbrooke"">@ROVBrooke</a>,First, kudos for digging so deep into what is going on with the video.Dropped frames are frames that the decoder process in chrome throws out for whatever reason. It can be pretty finicky. The recording process is not affected by the dropped frames that you see on the video statistics, and should be reliably recorded without drops for the most part.To explain more about why there are differences when turning hardware accel on and off in Chrome, the current version of the video stream that you are using is missing a set of special parameters in the H264 bitstream which tell the decoder that it should only buffer one frame, that there will be no B-frames, and that no frames will be coming out of order. The software decoder in Chrome doesnâ€™t seem to care about those parameters being missing, but the hardware decoder does, as it relies on them for making the best decisions from an optimization viewpoint. In a newer version of the camera server, we have been able to parse the H264 bitstream, modify and rebuild those parameter sets with values that leads to extremely low latency, and as a result, the decoder ends up not waiting for a buffer of 15 frames and choking as we push in new data (resulting in dropped frames in Chrome).These improvements will be rolled out over time as we have the opportunity. For now, using the software decoder on a decent CPU will give you the best results. On mobile, you are forced to use the hardware decoder, so no guarantees there until the new software is ready.Additionally, if recording quality is your goal, I would recommend against using a GOP length of 1. While 1 will allow the decoder to recover more quickly, the image quality will be severely degraded. As the video is coming across at 30fps, using a GOP length of 30 means that it will take up to one second for the decoder to recover from an error, so you can tune the GOP to your needs between 1 and 30, with video quality being improved as you increase it.",,,,,,ROVBrooke,"Hi Charles, Thanks for this reply. I will put all the recommendations to use and see what combination of settings well with my config.In the meantime Iâ€™ll look forward to the new builds that incorporate your enhancements.I did post a couple of other questions re: post dive video replay as well.

This should resolve your issue with downloading the recorded video from the Data page. In the event that this doesnâ€™t fix your particular issue, we should be able to recover it, as long as you donâ€™t clear your browserâ€™s cache in the meantime. The manual cache retrieval method is a bit of a nuisance and differs by OS, so letâ€™s wait and see if the new update resolves the issue first. In addition to the retrieval fixes, the other improvements that I mentioned in my previous post will also be making their way in, so you may start seeing better latency and less dropped frames at the decoder.We will post the new release on the forum, but I will also ping you here when we do so.Cheers,<br>Charles"Guide 2-Epoxy Questions,https://forum.openrov.com/t/guide-2-epoxy-questions/5357,OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8,381,Mar '17,2,Guide 2-Epoxy Questions - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,m3pandey,"Hello, I am about to use epoxy to waterproof the endcap with the db-25 cable.I have read a lot of forum posts where people have difficulty getting epoxy around all the wires and crevices, thus not making it fully waterproof.To avoid this problem, could I first fill some of the cavity with epoxy without the white acrylic backing lid on?

That being said, the electronics are being designed so that charging takes about the same time (~3 hours) as the vehicle can run. For major expeditions that have multiple vehicles, this would allow one vehicle to charge while the other is in operation. Itâ€™s also possible that an accessory could be made that would allow power to be sent down the tether, however the focus now is getting the core Trident design solid before developing accessories.â€Regards,<br>TCIII AVD"Motor questions,https://forum.openrov.com/t/motor-questions/5353,OpenROV Product Support,662,Mar '17,10,Motor questions - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,neil.souter,"Hi, Iâ€™m building my own rov but using the open rov electronics, why do the motors have three wires?

The exposed magnets tend to corrode easily. The bearings also need to be lubricated and protected from rust.<br>First, rinse the motors with fresh water (see previous step)<br>Then thoroughly dry the motors with compressed air (if available).<br>Immediately afterwards, re-apply spray silicon lubrication. Move the motors with you hands for a few rotations to ensure that the bearings are well lubricated. Review the previous steps on proper lubrication. This should be done before and after each and every dive.<br>WD-40 is great to keep the motors from corroding as it displaces any water.

What I do is I take the syringe out a few times while the air warms up, and then firmly press down on the end cap while putting the syringe back in. I do it as long as I hear pressure drop when I take it out. I do this as a pre dive procedure. Once the air is well warmed up you can shut down the rov and let the tube cool down until your dive. Be carefull if you want to take the syringe out though cause a negative pressure will have formed and the syringe might be hard to pull out. You donâ€™t want the syringe stick to break leaving the rubber part stuck in the end cap.",,,,,,Fe3C,"I can add that you have the same issues when traveling and diving between different heights as here also the pressure differences between tube and environment will change. As long as you are diving it should not be a problem, because the water pressure will just about always be greater than the pressure within the (warm) tube and the water cools the tube.Just be careful when handling the ROV between water and air, and long heat times. Before every dive, briefly take out the syringe, and make a pressure adjustment."OpenROV with Raspberry Pi,https://forum.openrov.com/t/openrov-with-raspberry-pi/5318,OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8,359,Feb '17,0,OpenROV with Raspberry Pi - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nvh3011,I have a Project.

And noted that when I ran the motors at 1â€¦ the port motor sounded very high pitch, whereas the starboard motor was at much more of a lower dull roar. I would presume that is another indicator something is not quite right, since Iâ€™d expect them to sound more or less the same (as a third data point the y-axis motor was also high pitched).",,,,,,Brendan,"I had a similar problem. It sounds like it could be a problem with one of  the motors bearings. Try loosening the mount of the starboard motor a little bit and see if this makes any difference. Also, I would suggest contacting support <a href=""http://www.openrov.com/support/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.openrov.com/support/</a> If itâ€™s a faulty bearing or defective motor they might send you a free replacement.",,,,,,acotter,"Thanks Brendan, will give that a whirl first.",,,,,,guillaume.ethier,"I have a similar issue. We have 2 rovs and the older oneâ€™s motors sound a lot more like the lower dull roar you described.

I bought some replacement motors though in case that did not work out â€“ so I have since replaced the dull roaring starboard motor (for my fellow older gaming geeks out there: it sounded much like the pterodactyl in Joust).The new motor â€“ after a somewhat touch in go installation â€“ is now in place and making the same high pitched sound as the other motor (or near enough anyway, not exactly the same).",,,,,,TCIII,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/acotter"">@acotter</a>,<br>Sounds like you may have a bad ESC driving that motor?<br>Regards,<br>TCIII AVD",,,,,,acotter,"Thanks.

I am using the Neutrally Buoyant Tether too.Thank you!",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi:As you may or may not know, the ROV is turned on by placing a 5V signal onto the tether.  This signal turns on the main power switch on the ROV controller board, allowing battery power to flow to the electrical circuitry.  So if your ROV is not powering on, either thereâ€™s something wrong with the battery connection inside the ROV, or for some reason the voltage is not running down the tether to turn the unit on.The first thing Iâ€™d check is to see whether the batteries are getting power to the ROV.  If your ROV is fully assembled right now, undo the main tube from the ROV, and pull off the acrylic tube so that you can work with the E-chassis while itâ€™s still plugged into the endcap.  On the controller board, find the empty (unstuffed) connector location named J12.  If youâ€™re looking at the board with the DB-25 connector on your left, it will be on the lower right side. Itâ€™s also marked â€œPwr switchâ€ or something like that.  Anyway, take a short piece of wire and short the two leads of J12 together.  This should turn the ROV on, regardless of whether you have the topside hooked up or not.  If the ROV turns on, then you have an issue with continuity in your tether.  If the ROV does not turn on, then thereâ€™s probably an issue with battery power not getting to the ROV.  Iâ€™d download the 2.8 Controller board schematic off of our Github site to help you with any debugging you might need to do.Let us know how your testing efforts go.-Walt",,,,,,paross76,"Thank you for the fast response. Shortly after posting this I found the db25 pin out. I tested both port and starboard banks and found zero volts.After quite a bit of head scratching I saw the batteries werenâ€™t even making contact with each other. I guess my coworker ordered the high capacity batteries but neglected to tell me that they needed modification prior to use. Anyway, I modified them and on she came.Again, thanks for the fast response.",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Glad that you got the problem solved.  For those who are puzzled over the battery comment,<a href=""http://openrov.dozuki.com/Guide/High+Capacity+Battery+Preparation/186""> hereâ€™s a Dozuki article</a> about prepping the batteries.  Although the article is about the high-capacity batteries, I do this with the white standard batteries as well.  In a nutshell, size 26650 batteries are made to be tabbed together in battery packs, not slipped into battery tubes.  To get reliable battery contact in tubes, you need to remove a bit of the heat-shrink insulation off of the bottom, and maybe add a dot of solder to the top battery contact as well.-W",,,,,,Shashank_Srinivasan,"Thank you for the tip re: shorting the J12 connector to troubleshoot power issues; it was really helpful.I wanted to test the OpenROVâ€™s electronics before potting the electronics, so I assembled my 2.8, successfully powered it up, disassembled it and then applied the epoxy resin. However, on reassembly, it didnâ€™t work; it seemed absolutely dead. I checked the electronics again, but couldnâ€™t find a break in the connection, and then found this post on the forums. When shorting the J12 didnâ€™t turn the OpenROV on, I checked the battery connections carefully and discovered that the epoxy had dripped through both battery tubes and had coated the spring-connectors completely, insulating the batteries completely.

When I got the ROV to surface, it turned out there was water inside the electronic tube. After some trouble shooting with vacuum pump and water, it turned out that the water came in on the outside of the syringe. I suspect that different material types between the epoxy and syringe, making different expansions at different temperatures can have caused this. My initial plan was to mold a plug with RTV silicone (I have equipment and silicone for molding), making a seal from the outside. But Iâ€™m also concerned that if this syringe get loose, it could pop into the tube, since there is nothing physically stopping it from moving in, itâ€™s just glued to the hole in the endcap. Was thinking of using a piece of plastic and cement it to the backside of the endcap (have some leftovers after HD Pro camera upgrade), with just a small hole for the syringe, making a support and preventing syringe from moving in.

It was intended to be used for short runs between PWBs. I believe that the I2C spec calls for one twist every inch or so in the cable to reduce noise susceptibility. I was using the I2C bus for thruster control and had a thruster that was 18 inches from the controller. I had to reduce the I2C bus clock frequency from 100kHz to 75kHz to maintain consistent communication with the thruster.As an example, I have a test bench setup of just the wire harness, motors, and a IMU Module. When I kept the I2C bus wires at the original wire harness length, I saw the fluctuations in the pressure reading that you are experiencing. So I cut the test bench I2C bus wire harness wires to the shorter length that I cut them to on my ROV chassis. After shortening the I2C bus wires, the readings became stable.<br>Regards,<br>TCIII AVD",,,,,,Jim_Scholz,Thanks for the response. I think my problem may have been with movement of the wires. I resecured the wires to the outer housing and it seems to have improved the situation.Any advice on re-calibration? My pitch and roll are off a bit.,,,,,,TCIII,"Hi Jim,<br>Since I was building a hybrid ROV I built a platform for the IMU Module that I could adjust in the roll axis unlike the OROV mounting scheme. Also, my IMU Module platform was parallel to the longitudinal axis of the ROV frame so it was level in the pitch axis.<br>During the potting of the IMU Module in its case I found that the solder joints on the bottom of the Module were about 0.030 in high. So I cut a very small piece of 0.030 in thick abs plastic and CAâ€™ed it on to the bottom of the opposite end of the Module pwb from the solder joints. This guaranteed that the pwb would be level in the acrylic case during the potting process.<br>My understanding is that OROV plans to add an offset calibration function to the next Cockpit firmware release to correct for minor offsets in the IMU Module pitch and roll axes like you are experiencing.<br>Regards,<br>TCIII AVD",,,,,,Win10 Cockpit Simulator build error - i2c.cc can&#39;t include sys/ioctl.h - Trident - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,webhoppery,"When doing the npm install of the cloned openrov-cockpit, it couldnâ€™t find the sys\ioctl.h file included by <a href=""http://i2c.cc"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">i2c.cc</a>.How do I tell npm install, MSBuild.exe, where the included sys\ioctl.h file is?Did:<br>git clone <a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-cockpit.git"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-cockpit.git</a>set NODE_ENV=production<br>set npm_config_shrinkwrap=true<br>node installIt was using :<br>MSBuild.exe       C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0&gt;<br>Verion 14.0.24720.0Probably some newbie mistake, but Iâ€™d like to get familiar with the Cockpit before the Trident ships.Thanks"[SOLVED] A problem with firmware upload after 30.0.3 update,https://forum.openrov.com/t/solved-a-problem-with-firmware-upload-after-30-0-3-update/5169,OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8,838,Jan '17,11,[SOLVED] A problem with firmware upload after 30.0.3 update - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,russellstanford,"Hello all,I have a 2.7 edition developers kit I am working on using to control my ROV.

There is a bootloader on the controller board. I can have to re-burn this onto the board (it will not hurt anything to run it again) to see if this much smaller amount of data will get through.It will determine if the two boards are communicating with each other at all.

Any misalignment of the DB-25 connector on the End Cap or a misalignment of the Pass-Though End Cap plates could cause the Controller Board to be misaligned in the WTC causing the O ring straps to contact the inside of the WTC?However, I just took a look at my 2.8 Controller Board with the new HD-Pro Camera Upgrade and determined that the O ring straps should not hit the inside of the WTC if the Camera Platform has been assembled and installed correctly on the Electronics Chassis.You can verify the correct assembly and installation of the Camera Platform in the Electronics Chassis by laying the Electronics Chassis with the camera facing down on a flat surface. If the Camera Platform has been assembled and installed correctly on the Electronics Chassis you should be able to manually swing the Camera Platform back and forth from its center position, while rotating the Electronics Chassis from side to side, without it contacting the flat surface. If the O rings are contacting the flat surface at any point in the swing of Camera Platform from its center position, then you may have some kind of assembly error in either the Camera Platform or the Electronics Chassis.Could you possibly provide some pictures of the Controller Board in the WTC and of the Pass-Through End Cap?<br>Regards,<br>TCIII AVD",,,,,,geoffreyash,"Thanks, I may have figured it out.I did the test you mentioned about rotating the camera with the chassis out on the bench and the o rings would touch the bench the entire time, no matter what tilt angle or chassis position. So the camera is obviously protruding too far forward.Then I remembered that while installing the camera platform on the chassis I had a lot of space between the ends of the platform and the chassis walls (going back through the build instructions it does state to make sure those end pieces on the camera platform are â€œflush in both directions and at a 90 degree angleâ€â€¦maybe I didnâ€™t set them right)<br>So I ended up putting an extra plastic nut between the chassis wall and the camera platform bracket as a spacer on the non-servo side.<br>When I remove that â€œspacerâ€ and tighten down the screws the two attachment legs of the camera platform pull slightly outwards toward the chassis walls, effectively pulling the front of camera back a littleâ€¦just enough to give clearance.I didnâ€™t boot it up, but I could rotate the camera platform manually inside the tube so it should be fine.  I just hope the pressure on those end pieces doesnâ€™t translate into another problem down the road.",,,,,,geoffreyash,"<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/b/b5e4186d7cec2e82d2dffc3ced2d56bfb7904885.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/b5e4186d7cec2e82d2dffc3ced2d56bfb7904885"" title=""IMG_1064-2000.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">IMG_1064-2000.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">2000x1500 547 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/6/649469e26eb963bc6ad7a27420ecb801c11ebcdf.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/649469e26eb963bc6ad7a27420ecb801c11ebcdf"" title=""IMG_1070-2000.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">IMG_1070-2000.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">2000x1500 483 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/f/f698b6f4235d8b30a3be11a390872d0717f47517.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/f698b6f4235d8b30a3be11a390872d0717f47517"" title=""IMG_1066-2000.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">IMG_1066-2000.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">2000x1500 491 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/5/536cb8ea7bb77879727b2e6c3cbb7eaeaa14e2de.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/536cb8ea7bb77879727b2e6c3cbb7eaeaa14e2de"" title=""IMG_1065-2000.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">IMG_1065-2000.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">2000x1500 581 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/7/7832f7ae7835030904efd9b84223f75442f5a093.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/7832f7ae7835030904efd9b84223f75442f5a093"" title=""IMG_1071-2000.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">IMG_1071-2000.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">2000x1500 555 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/6/6a99aa143c44c396e101882a25a4ce5feaa2916f.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/6a99aa143c44c396e101882a25a4ce5feaa2916f"" title=""IMG_1069-2000.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">IMG_1069-2000.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">2000x1500 490 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/8/8a6bab6a54f4b58069576b1f42d41f8ba5ec3f4a.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/8a6bab6a54f4b58069576b1f42d41f8ba5ec3f4a"" title=""IMG_1072-2000.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">IMG_1072-2000.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">2000x1500 523 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/9/95adf76f6f25596f4096b8d9ab9891cb40b9e5af.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/95adf76f6f25596f4096b8d9ab9891cb40b9e5af"" title=""IMG_1073-2000.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""666"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">IMG_1073-2000.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">2000x1500 502 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div>",,,,,,TCIII,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/geoffreyash"">@geoffreyash</a>,<br>Glad to hear that you found the problem and were able to correct it.<img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:""><br>Regards,<br>TCIII AVD"STEP/STL of DTS 700 Motor mounts anyone?,https://forum.openrov.com/t/step-stl-of-dts-700-motor-mounts-anyone/5154,OpenROV 2.5 -

In the Cockpit you can enable, disable or upload plugins from the web. Normally in the 30.0.3 SW suite, the plugin for the IMU2 is already available.

Iâ€™d check your power supply and make sure the voltage isnâ€™t sagging as the ROV boots up.

This will force the ESCs to power-up at the same time as the rest of the board does, so the ATmega microcontroller and the BBB will boot <em>after</em> the inrush surge from the ESCs.You can download the schematic for the 2.8 controller board off of our Github site, if youâ€™re curious as to what that jumper is doing.-W",,,,,,1armedfreak,"I got everything working if I power the controller board with a psu, both the top side home plug and bbb with usb and completely remove the on board home plug module, any ideas?Also I want to program the digital i/o pins to control dc motors is there any guide that demonstrates how to do this.",,,,,,Trident: For &quot;light&quot; commercial use? - Trident - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,christian.paulsen89,"Hi,I am in the process of looking at the possibilities of using TRIDENT as an light inspection ROV,  the main task will be to inspect vessels propellers and fish net for the fish farmâ€™s we have here and possible other types of inspection if needed.1.I see that it has gyroâ€™s, does that mean that it will have a mode so it can keep the ROV stabilized while slowly inspect things under water for good video?<br>2.The promo videos looks good, but as all promo video they look way to good.

But then the diodes will have a voltage drop and need to be sized for current and you will draw 100% of your power from the higher voltage pack until it drops, then you will share for a little bit, then whichever one goes lower first will drop out and finally you will oscillate between the two.  You would never get double the power buy paralleling the battery packs.The complex answer is if each battery pack feeds itâ€™s own voltage regulator and they are setup in a master/slave configuration so they both maintain the same output voltage onto the power buss then it can work.  But at this point is probably cheaper to get two battery packs with the same chemistry batteries.One other thought, if you are paralleling two battery packs and they are physically separate you should ensure the connection is using  low resistance or equal resistance wire otherwise you will get something very similar to having packs of different voltage.Wires (a) should be the same size and length as wires (b).",,,,,,kyril_acap,"yes, thanks lawrenceâ€¦<br>i though as muchâ€¦<br>im trying to explore the latter idea<br>im just not sure of the power flow inside the controller board ciruitâ€¦"Two controller boards,https://forum.openrov.com/t/two-controller-boards/4994,OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8,935,Nov '16,5,Two controller boards - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,j8rick62,"Hello,<br>Is it possible , or worth the effort to run two controller boards together with one BBB ?

Therefore attempting to use the OROV power system directly to power six T100s will not be possible and six OROV brushless motors will consume 10 amps more than the power system can supply.A solution to this problem is to use the OROV power system to power three of the thrusters and draw power directly from the batteries to power the other three thrusters bypassing the OROV power system.

Then the rush in current due to salt water in the battery tube increased the pressure in the tube pushing the faulty glue out and letting more water in the battery tube.In my opinion there is two issues here:It shouldnâ€™t be a problem taking the E-tube out of the ROV with out the risk of damaging the wiring harness due to slite bending of the wires.<br>How about to design it as a whole cable with penetrators instead as other ROVâ€™s have?",,,,,,TCIII,"Hi Tom,<br>Sorry to hear about your sealing issues with your wire harness. Operation in very cold water will cause the wire and the wire insulation to stiffen and make epoxy start to become brittle.  I agree that the 2.6 configuration that you have does have some weaknesses.<br>The OpenROV 2.8 wire harness and End Cap routing is about as good a sealing method that you can get if done properly. Being able to anchor the DB-25 connector to the entrance of the wire harness trough (I used CA Kicker around the flange of the DB-25 connector to ensure that the connector flange would bond quickly with the  CA spread around the periphery of the wire harness End Cap entrance) and then forcing the 2 Ton epoxy into the trough virtually guarantees an even distribution of epoxy around each individual wire and the elimination of all air pockets in the trough. Also, I found that routing the wires side by side in the trough instead of just a jumbled wire bundle helped to ensure that the epoxy coated all of the wires completely and forced the air out of the trough.<br>I have built several 2.8 End Cap assemblies and have been able to pull a 560 mm Hg vacuum on the WTC for over two hours even without the ends of the wires in the wire harness being sealed. I have found that attention to detail in the application of the 2 Ton epoxy to the wire harness trough in the End Cap is very important for a good waterproof seal.<br>Regards,<br>TCIII AVD",,,,,,Tom_Vidar_Salangli,"Thanks for respondâ€¦<br>Yes, I agree that the 2.8 is a better wayâ€¦ now, since I have this 2.6 I can not use 2.8 end caps.<br>I have sent OpenROV an email wanting to buy new end cap and harness.

For the price, I figured it was worth trying out. When first starting cockpit, it works great. The frame rate is good, and the image is clearer in low light.

The CPU usage on my PC is also higher than usual, but none of my cores are maxed. I plugged the camera into my computer, and there were no issues at all, so I donâ€™t think the camera is faulty.Considering this is a 720p camera, and the config.js setting is â€˜SXGAâ€™, could the issue be with video scaling? Nowhere in the code could I find the definition for â€˜SXGAâ€™, although I know this to be 1280x1024. What input format does the resolution option in config.js expect?

I believe this will continue with the Trident.",,,,,,Eric_Stackpole,"Hi Peter,Sorry for the delay in getting back to you (and thank you, Brendan, for helping to answer some of these questions)!Iâ€™ve copied and pasted your questions below so I can answer in-line.<strong>1. For how long will the pre-sales campaign go on?</strong><br>We plan to continue pre-selling Tridents through the time we start shipping, but the pre-sale price may increase in the next month or two. An important thing to note is that we will be fulfilling pre-sales in the order they were placed, so earlier orders will receive their Trident earlier.<strong>2. Will the Trident be able to go in reverse? I assume that will be possible, but I canâ€™t remember seeing any videos where it does that. And I imagine that it will come in handy in some situations.</strong><br>Yep! All three thrusters on Trident are fully reversible, so the vehicle can move forward and backward, turn, and go up and down.<strong>3. If any of the parts (electrical or mechanical) in Trident stops working/breaks, will it be possible to open it up and change those, or do you have to throw the whole thing away and buy a new one? Because no matter how good the parts are, there is always a possibility of something breaking, and if everything is in a sealed case/cast you are pretty much screwed.</strong><br>(both questions answered below)<strong>4. Will you have any sorts of warranty? If yes, can you give some hint of what it will be like? Will I get a new Trident if it is not due to any â€œpilot/driver failureâ€?</strong>We are still working on the details of our repair and return policy, but we plan to stand by our product. One of the main focuses in the design of Trident has been to make it drastically more reliable than any other ROV on the market. That being said, if something does go wrong we want to make sure there is a reasonable solution for fixing it. Internal components most often fail due to mishandling and leaks, and for that reason the body of Trident is sealed at the factory to assure that that process is done correctly. In general, failures most often occur to moving parts such as motors, so in addition to making our thrusters as robust as possible, weâ€™ve also designed them to be user-replaceable should the need occur.<strong>5. Will there be a gamepad/remote control included in the package, or do you have a list of which gamepads that will work with Trident?</strong><br>Trident can be controlled directly from any WiFi device it is connected to such as a smartphone, tablet, or laptop. Weâ€™ve developed our software to also allow external gamepads to be connected to these devices to give pilots a higher level of control sensitivity. For laptops, most USB gamepad controllers should work, but the most popular and affordable one people use for OpenROV is the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-940-000110-Gamepad-F310/dp/B003VAHYQY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475463928&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=f310"">Logitech F310</a>. If you want the best of the best, my recommendation would be the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/DualShock-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-Black-4/dp/B00KVP76G0/ref=sr_1_3?s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475464029&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=ps4%2Bcontroller&amp;th=1"">Sony DualShock 4 PS4 controller</a>. PS4 controllers are more expensive, but in our experience they are worth it. PS4 controllers also support bluetooth which can allow them to connect wirelessly to both laptops and mobile devices without USB.<strong>6. I have read that there will be different attachments available in the future (for example extra lights, grip claw etc.) Will most of those be available for purchase on your web page, or will that only be from third party â€œdevelopersâ€ that I have to search for my self on the web?</strong><br>We plan to sell an array of payloads and accessories for Trident as OpenROV products in our store. Over time, we hope our catalog of available accessories as well as the sophistication of those accessories will increase. We also expect that youâ€™ll also be able to find more niche payloads (such as sensors used for specific types of scientific research, etc) as 3rd party items that can be found elsewhere. Building a community and ecosystem around our platform is important to us, so we hope new ideas for payloads will be developed and shared here on our forums. We also plan to make parts and kits for developing custom payloads available in our store.<strong>7. Will it be possible to upgrade the software in Trident and will you continue develop it for better image quality, better accuracy in calculating the position of the Trident and also maybe add new features?</strong><br>Absolutely! We will constantly be working on improvements and new features for our software. Weâ€™re also developing a way to make downloading and installing those updates as easy as possible. Many IOT devices today struggle with sending out new software to products that have already been shipped, but we hope to make Trident a device that can constantly be improved as development progresses.I hope these answer your questions, but please feel free to write back of thereâ€™s anything else youâ€™d like to know about.

I had enough free length to get it to shore, but I ended up having to cut the tether two feet from the openrov so I could recover the vehicle itself. I ended up having to leave a bit of cable in the lake, around 10m. Since I have to solder the cable back together, I want to make sure whatever I do doesnâ€™t degrade the strength of the cable too much.Questions:I did learn some interesting lessons from this, so others: donâ€™t repeat my mistake. Docks in the PNW (Iâ€™d assume else where also) have tons of old crap (fallen pilings, previous dock materials) on the bottom near them, and no matter how cool something is, donâ€™t land on the bottom and <em>then</em> move forward. Iâ€™m pretty sure I was fine until the proximity to the bottom and jerking forward caused the line itself to move under an old, fallen piling and catch.Iâ€™d also love to hear other peopleâ€™s approach to following the tether back down, especially from shore. I spent almost an hour tracing my previous dive path to find the snag, only to find my attempts from above to loosen it had only made everything worse.",,,,,,chrisethompson,"I had a similar issue where the ROV was snagged and I had to cut the cable, but I didnâ€™t have enough to get the ROV back to shore.  Is was about 3 meters away and I had to swim out and cut the cable.To fix it you want to go back to the instructions for attaching the tether and re-attach it again.  Remove the short tail that you have and get back to the wires that emerge from the tube, where you originally soldered the tether.  You need the cable to be wrapped around the long zip tie and the solder joint to have no strain at all.I have also upgraded to the water proof connector that you highlighted.  It is very strong and can certainly support the weight of the ROV.  When I have wanted to be really sure of the strength I have also tied the cable through the carry handle, after the water proof connector.  Then I know that I am pulling on that knot rather than on the coupling.  It is probably not needed though.  Someone should do a test and demonstrate that the join and connector is stronger than the cable itself.",,,,,,Lawrence,"The connect mentioned say itâ€™s IP68 which is protected from long term exposure up to a vendor noted pressure.  There is no â€˜specâ€™ on this connector and it says not certified so I would not trust it beyond a meter or two for say 30min.  Certainly make sure that failure does not allow water to wick up the tether and back into the rover.My initial thoughts would be to twist and solder the wires, cover them in liquid electrical tape and then shrink wrap.

I use a Logitech C920, which has inbuilt H264 encoding and stream using Gstreamer through a Raspberry Pi to my laptop. I easily get 720/25fps with very low latency and can even do 1080, although my laptop screen resolution isnâ€™t high enough.I cannot recall what the OpenROV 2.8 uses but I am pretty sure it does not have inbuilt H264 encoding, thus requiring the beaglebone to do some processing.I would imagine the new HD camera being offered has some solution to provide high speed encoding as well as superior low light sensitivity.

This causes increased latency and the decreased frame rate.The new HD camera we have been designing to be fantastic for capturing underwater video. The camera encodes into an H.264 stream which decreases the latency and reduces the CPU load on the BeagleBone Black. The camera has a high dynamic range to handle high contrast situations and works much better in low light situations. The lens and focus is also set to match the sensor and the underwater environment. We have spent a lot of time on the design of this camera (for Trident as well as for the 2-series) because we know this is the most important sensor on the vehicle.Having flown with both cameras I find the new one much better. While the image quality is better the biggest difference is in the latency. We have been working to reduce it as much as possible and makes the vehicle much more responsive because when you give a control command you get very fast visual feedback of the change in direction.

As Iâ€™ve gotten more comfortable and adventurous with my ROV thereâ€™s been a few issues, mainly solved by reading through these forums.But I have one annoyance that I canâ€™t seem to fix as of yet: When I rise straight up, the whole ROV twists in the water. Itâ€™s worse at higher motor settings, but noticeable at a 2 as well. Itâ€™s always the same direction, to the left, and I donâ€™t have any evidence of it happening when descendingI have the IMU sensor installed and nothing out of the ordinary.Thanks for the help, super excited to explore more.<a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cqrg19BUEAEJV9H.jpg:large"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cqrg19BUEAEJV9H.jpg:large</a><br>Bonus: picture of a car on the bottom of Lake Washington, Seattle.",,,,,,charlesdc,"Hi <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/pazrul"">@pazrul</a>,This is caused by the fact that the OpenROV 2.8 only has one vertical thruster. Iâ€™m sure someone more mechanically inclined can provide a better/more detailed explanation than the following, but the basic reason is this:When a prop spins in some fluid, be it air or water, depending on which way it is turning, it creates two primary forces. The first is the force along the axis about which the propeller rotates, and the other is a torque opposite to the direction of the rotation of the prop, on the body to which the thruster is attached (in this case your ROV). For vehicles such as quadrotors and helicopters, there are additional props which provide a countertorque to prevent rotation of the vehicle as a result of this. On quadrotors, two of the props rotate in the opposite direction to allow for fine control and balancing of the rotational forces on the vehicle. If you slow down one set of rotors and speed up the others, you can maintain altitude while rotating the vehicle. For helicopters without counter rotating vertical rotors, the tail rotor is what provides the ability to counter this torque and also give you control of the vehicleâ€™s yaw.As the OpenROV only has one vertical rotor, there is no counter to the torque, and that is why you see the rotation when you go up and down. However, you can use the port and starboard thrusters to counter the torque. As you have the IMU, you can put the vehicle into heading hold while you ascend and descend and it should help to counter the twisting.",,,,,,pazrul,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/charlesdc"">@charlesdc</a> Thanks so much for the detailed response. I thought the single vertical thruster might have something to do with it, but I appreciate for the clarification.Iâ€™ll try setting heading hold in the future, Iâ€™m sure that will work just fine.Thanks!",,,,,,bokum,It sounds like code could be written to run one of the aft thrusters to counter act the twisting.Just built mine and will be testing in a few days.,,,,,,TCIII,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/bokum"">@bokum</a>,<br>I was going to suggest the same thing, but figured that the OpenROV software developers might have that in mind for the next software release as it really make sense to do so.<br>Regards,<br>TCIII AVD",,,,,,pazrul,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/bokum"">@bokum</a> Iâ€™m curious to see how much twisting you see on yours, Iâ€™d appreciate it if youâ€™d update once youâ€™d done some testing.

When I reworked a lot of the firmware, I made the decision to let the controls side of things for the 2.X series sit on the backburner, mainly because I knew that I would eventually be developing a new system for the Trident. Part of the work Iâ€™m doing now is the development of a new set of control schemes which are mainly applicable to Trident, but will also likely serve as a significant upgrade to the 2.X series as well (or at least those equipped with the IMU+Depth sensor).The primary mode of control that we are imagining the Trident to be piloted with is two controllers working together which can interchangeably be absolute position or rate controllers. For example, The depth controller can be set in absolute position mode, while the yaw controller can be set in rate mode, allowing the user to maintain a constant depth without needing to touch the controls, while the yaw/throttle axes of the joystick can be used to manoeuvre in a 2D plane. When you let go of the joystick, you will be essentially commanding a 0 deg/s yaw rate, which will drive the control system to bring you to a stop. You could also put the yaw controller in absolute mode, and it will maintain a fixed heading (to the best of the sensorâ€™s abilities to estimate the heading). In absolute mode, you have the option to lock the control such that yaw inputs on the gamepad donâ€™t affect it any more, or allow the setpoint to be modified by the controller in a sort of â€œcarrot on a stickâ€ control scheme. In general, we expect that most people will prefer to control the depth with a modifiable setpoint, in the same way that depth lock works on the 2.X series, while the yaw mode will vary depending on the userâ€™s preferences and the situation.This development is important for the 2.X as well, because it currently does not have a rate controller, and the vertical and horizontal control planes are currently entirely decoupled, so short of using the existing heading and depth lock controls, you canâ€™t achieve isolated vertical control. Arguably, because of the uncertainty in the sensors we have, the arrangement of the thrusters, the unknown underwater dynamics, propeller dynamics, and more, you can never achieve perfect control along any given control surface with the 2.X series (or any vehicle), but with a proper control allocation step, we can improve the situation.The new control software that I will be working on will feature the following to hopefully achieve a flexible and more complete set of control mechanisms:An allocation stage which includes a model of the vertical thrusterâ€™s effect on the yaw axis combined with a rate controller allowing only user requested yaw inputs, should be the answer to eliminate the twist while not having to put the vehicle in heading hold, as addressed in this thread. Once the Trident implementations are mature and tested, I will definitely be looking into bringing the 2.X series in line. That said, we certainly encourage anyone to feel free to write a new CThruster configuration or CAutopilot implementation in the current firmware and give a shot at tackling the problem.We are also completely open to discussing new control schemes and methods going forward, so feel free to voice any ideas you might like to see explored. Having so few sensors inputs, so many unknowns, and strange, unmodeled dynamics, precise control of the 2.X is a tricky subject which will probably require some clever thinking to tackle beyond what Iâ€™ve got planned.",,,,,,TCIII,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/charlesdc"">@charlesdc</a>,<br>A nice analysis of the ROV dynamics and interaction.<br>It will indeed be nice when your Trident axis control philosophy is migrated to the OpenROV2.x series.<br>Regards,<br>TCIII AVD",,,,,,Fe3C,"Just minor addition to <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/charlesdc"">@charlesdc</a>. The effect has not correlation with the thruster rotating in some kind of fluid but also works perfectly well in vacuum. Imagine an OpenROV flying without gravitation on the ISS (space station). Once you power a thruster, the prop will start rotating. Because of the counter momentum the whole ROV will turn in the opposite direction, maintaining the momentum equilibrium (overall the momentum of the vehicle is constant)."Setup for video capture,https://forum.openrov.com/t/setup-for-video-capture/4032,OpenROV Product Support,1.1k,Aug '16,3,Setup for video capture - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fe3C,"Can anyone recommend the best way to capture the live video feed from the OpenROV?So far, I am using VLC to transform the video feed from â€œ<a href=""http://openrov.local:8090/?action=stream"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://openrov.local:8090/?action=stream</a>â€ to a video file.

Everything is working except the headlights. I can unplug the lights from the board and connect them to an external power supply and they work fine. With the lights unplugged I checked the voltages on the P1+ and P1- pins at the connector and it ranges from 9.5 down and up as expected when controlled by the console o and p keys. However If I set the light control on full (9.5v) and plug the lights in, the voltage drops from the 9.5v to around 1.65v (no lights). Its like the board cannot supply enough current to drive the lights. I can achieve the same result with the lights in a standalone configuration connected an external variable power supply, leaving the voltage set to 9.5v the LEDs will light and dim to off by decreasing the supplyâ€™s current adjustment.",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"A couple of questions:Did the lights work before you updated the software to 30.0.3?When you hooked the LED lights up to an external power supply, how much current did they draw?The power PWM channels are generally pretty reliable, though itâ€™s not impossible that youâ€™ve got a bad one for some reason.  You might want to download the schematic for the 2.6 controller board from the OpenROV GitHub site, and I can help to walk you through the PWM circuitry.-Walt",,,,,,wdhorner,"Thanks for responding Walt. The lights have never worked which is one reason why I tried upgrading to 30.0.3. The upgrade went smoothly as expected. Everything else seems to work fine. Although I really havenâ€™t checked the IMU yet. But all motors, the camera, the laser measurement lights, and servo work fine. When the lights are unplugged from the ROV and connected to the standalone power supply the LED lights appear to draw 40 mA.  I have the lights with two square pads with 9 LEDS on each. I downloaded the 2.6 schematics.<br>Bill",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Bill:If you have the 2.6 schematic, then you can trace out where the current for the lights flows, and measure each step with a voltmeter to see where the issue lies.Look on the top left of sheet 6 and you will see the circuitry that drives the lights (PWM1).  Starting from the (+) battery bus (called V_BAT on the schematic), current goes through R28, to PWM1+, returns via PWM1-, and then through Q4 to ground.  Iâ€™d take a voltmeter with one side connected to a ground test point.  With the LEDs plugged in, turn the lights on full in software, and then probe at all of these points.  If youâ€™re only getting around 1.6V across the LED board (PWM1+ to PWM1-), then there must be about 8V of drop somewhere else.  When you find that voltage drop, youâ€™ll know how to fix the issue.Let us know how things work out.-Walt",,,,,,wdhorner,"Hi Walt, Iâ€™m not a EE but my guess is that Q4 is bad. It looks to me like Q4 is never fully turning on, so â€œPWM 1-â€œ never drops below around 8.5 V and hence the voltage difference presented to the lights is around 1+ volts . I measured the voltage at R26 to be 9.4V.<br>I measured the voltages at the Drain and Gate of Q4 for each bar of the illumination setting and got the following.Bars__D__G<br>8__ 8.5__3.5<br>7__8.6__3.12<br>6__8.7__2.68<br>5__8.6__2.23<br>4__8.8__1.79<br>3__8.9__1.34<br>2__9.3__0.9<br>1__9.3__0.45I put a scope on the Q4 Gate and the signal there seems to be working as expected.Lights Off<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/e/e75a7bcc9875451f2cdd9f2c8313e4d25852683b.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/e75a7bcc9875451f2cdd9f2c8313e4d25852683b"" title=""Lights Off.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""582"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">Lights Off.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">1617x1388 415 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div>1 Bar<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/9/91c16b26d16784e5499a03329f7924b7784dae7f.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/91c16b26d16784e5499a03329f7924b7784dae7f"" title=""Lights On 1Bar.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""570"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">Lights On 1Bar.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">1585x1388 411 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div>7 Bar<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/f/f9226b2efe3ddeb13d65d667b34ab7c4231306f6.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/f9226b2efe3ddeb13d65d667b34ab7c4231306f6"" title=""Lights On 7Bar.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""575"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">Lights On 7Bar.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">1717x1493 467 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div>On - Full Brightness<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/2/2d2a1648e2434d9273246b24aeb5ef387ee496d4.JPG"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/2d2a1648e2434d9273246b24aeb5ef387ee496d4"" title=""Lights On.JPG"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""569"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">Lights On.JPG</span><span class=""informations"">1449x1272 309 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div>",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Bill:Yep, Q4 is probably bad.  If youâ€™re handy with a soldering iron, it shouldnâ€™t be that hard to replace.  The transistor is easily available from Digi-Key (see the BOM on the GitHub site if you need the part #), or, if you figure youâ€™re never going to use PWM channel 4, you can try desoldering Q7 and moving that good transistor over into the Q4 slot.-W",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Bill:One idea to try before desoldering Q4 is that perhaps one of the leads has a cold solder joint on it.  Try pushing on Q4 while you have the lights enabled, and see if that causes them to suddenly turn on.  Or, just resolder the 3 leads of Q4 with fresh solder.  If neither of those things work, then you probably have to pull Q4 off and replace it.-W",,,,,,wdhorner,"Thanks Walt, I had already tried resoldering but no effect.

What is happening to cause that is that the openrov_config.sh script in /opt/openrov/cockpit/linux/ is unable to detect which controller board you are on. It checks that by trying to communicate to the ATmega2560 over the SPI port. If you have altered your linux setup in a way that makes the SPI port inaccessible, or if your controllerboard is damaged in some way that damages the ATMega or the SPI bus, the script will fail to detect the arduino. Since that version of the software still supports the Cape setup, it will assume that a lack of Arduino on the SPI port means you must be connected to an Arduino ATMega328p on the cape, and will attempt to build the firmware for that target. The 328p does not have an A8 pin, so the compilation will fail in the manner you are seeing.In summary, you may have a damaged controllerboard or you may have inadvertently compromised your SPI interface on the BBB and may want to contact support.",,,,,,Trinh,"I have use another new BBB but it still fail,I think I need contact supportâ€¦If controllerboard was actually broken, what should I do:cry:",,,,,,hudson_james2007,"I had also faced the same issue.Just remove the A from <a href=""http://A8.It"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">A8.It</a> will start working",,,,,,charlesdc,"While that would work to fix the compilation step, it wonâ€™t fix your ability to communicate over SPI to the atmega, so you wonâ€™t be able to upload the code you compiled.<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/trinh"">@Trinh</a> I just noticed in one of your earlier posts that you tried to build your code using:I hadnâ€™t noticed that before.

With wet/damp hands a small zap that you would easily survive on dry land could easily kill you. It only takes a few mA through the heart to die and water rapidly lowers the resistance of the human body.

When you said â€œIâ€™ll just use regular AC from the net at 220V/50Hz thoughâ€ and you didnâ€™t mention RCDâ€™s, earth leakage detectors, double insulation or any other safety devices, I became concerned that this is not a safe project for you to construct. Appropriate wiring standards need to be observed when dealing with mains or the setup could be quite illegal in most countries. If you have a small leak in the converter you could have a fire and lose your ROV. Professional ROVâ€™s use appropriate standards to manage safety with AC and water. You could lose your life if you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing. Thatâ€™s the very very dangerous danger.",,,,,,marcus2,"What Brendan said.<br>220V AC is lethal.

The twisted pair then feed back actually voltage at vehicle to the surface powersupply.<br>I guess you could easy make up a power unit using a lawn mower motor and a car alternator. The feedback would then feed the subsea voltage back up to the regulator.

Our diver dropped into pool to grab the equipment. He took hold of an endcap. This end cap came loose and we flooded the tube with pool water (chlorinated). We unplugged as soon as possible (within a few moments of breach).We have taken these steps, within 30 mins flushed the electronics with distilled water. Used pressurized air to blowout all the visible moisture. Disassembled the major parts and flushed them again with 99.9% Isopropanol. Used pressurized air again to dry again.I am planning to put (visibly) dry components in bags with desiccant as soon as they are blown out.Is there any other advice on trying to mitigate the damage?",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Youâ€™ve taken pretty good steps so far.  When you say youâ€™ve disassembled the major parts, make sure that you take the electronics fully apart- take the BBB and the homeplug adapter off of the controller board, and the RJ-45 cable off as well.  The isopropanol flush should have a low enough viscosity to get into all the connector sockets to dry them out.  Also, on the camera, unscrew the lens and check for moisture in the lens holder.While flushing stuff, make sure you flush out the electronics endcap with the DB-25 connector!  That endcap is the hardest single piece of the ROV to replace (itâ€™s pretty much the heart of the ROV), so itâ€™s important that it gets rinsed and dried as soon as possible.Packing components in desiccant is OK, but you might want to also try an oven.  Start up the oven, set it to as low a temperature as it will go (maybe something like 170 degrees F), and wait a bit for the oven to stabilize at the low temperature.  Then pop all your electronics in the oven.  The high heat will evaporate any residual moisture much faster than desiccant at room temperature will.  You might want to leave the oven door cracked to allow moisture to escape.The reason I say to wait before stuffing things in the oven is that some ovens (mine, for one) will overshoot in temperature when they start up.  You donâ€™t want to melt the plastic pieces in the electronics!Let us know how things go.-W",,,,,,kidneutrino,"Thanks for the timely reply, Walt.

Moreover, Iâ€™ve also read that lights must be placed as far away from the camera as possible.About the camera, Iâ€™m looking for a cctv camera, but I havenâ€™t found too much information, is that a good option? What would you recommend me?Do you think all this camera and lighting configuration would be enough? Has any of you tried in similar conditions?Iâ€™ve heard something about a clarifying image element that is added to the camera or to the dome, but Iâ€™ve been able to find anything but digital filters such as <a href=""http://www.lyyn.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.lyyn.com/</a> (Any reference?)Thank you in advance, Pedro.",,,,,,Stretch,"Hi Pedro,Itâ€™s not uncommon for visibility in a harbor or near shore to be very poor and is usually caused by a very high volume of suspended solids and bio organisms.  If the visibility is poor ( a few meter or less) very bright lights may make it even worse.  Unless the lights are placed properly (spaced as far apart as possible) too much light will reflect off the suspended particles and back to the camera.The Lynn video system is basically a video post processor.  Iâ€™ve accomplished something similar using RoboRealm ( <a href=""http://www.roborealm.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.roborealm.com/</a> ) but the results will depend on a number of factors and may not be sufficient for your purposes.What you really need in poor visibility is sonar.

Iâ€™m new to underwater SFM , though Iâ€™ve done some work around (VO)Visual Odometry and semi-dense scene reconstructions on the KITTI dataset (mostly based on minimizing 3D-2D reprojection errors). Iâ€™m not sure how well the standard techniques would work underwater. Is there some good literature on this ?Iâ€™d be very interested to see if we can make use of stereo setups for underwater VO.  There are some open source solutions like libviso2 which I have been trying to improve using a version of rao blackwellised particle filter with visual odometric motion model. If the standard model holds underwater with some corrections, this can pave way for improved navigation and drift correction on the openrov itself.I also came across Prof. Blair Thorntonâ€™s work (<a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335440"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335440</a> ) where they used a mapping device consisting of a camera and sheet laser. The idea there was to have the sheet laser in the cameraâ€™s FOV and extract 3D points corresponding to the laser line for a bathymetric model. The color information was recovered on a per pixel basis from the camera for the 3D points by accounting for the motion which was recovered from the navigation information.If there are any datasets available, Iâ€™d love to look into this myself.Regards,<br>Akshay",,,,,,alan.buchanan,"Thanks Akshay,I will find some information for you.Underwater photogrammetry does work but the challenge is to extend it to<br>include other sensors to develop and combined solution that generates<br>real world coordiantesMore than happy to share what i am doing.Alan",,,,,,akshay.raj,Thanks Alan. Very happy that youâ€™ve taken this up for your masterâ€™s thesis and are open to sharing results.For sensor fusion you could be looking at an ekf based approach. Has this been done in the past with VO/IMU? I have tried DVL+IMU in the past.  Maybe use visual odom as a continuous source of odometric information. We may need to characterise the noise for that in underwater setting. Then try to fuse rotations from an IMU (VO doesnâ€™t typically give good rotations in my experience). Acoustic bearing and elevation (if available) can be fused as you would in the case of discreet GPS measurements.

The PWM channels were designed for about 1 Amp maximum, and the programming resistors (R24-R35) are size 0603 to reflect this.  A pair of light cubes draws about 1.5 amps.This morning I reviewed the trace sizes used to carry power within the PWM circuitry, and I think youâ€™ll be OK as long as you use a programming jumper that can handle the current.  A stock 0603 0-ohm resistor is only rated for 1 amp, but if you use, say, a small chunk of 22-ga solid wire, I think youâ€™ll be fine.So I think in your case, what I would do is to solder a small piece of solid copper wire (22 gauge or so) across the pads of R32, which will bring battery voltage out on the PWM3 channel.  Then wire the PWM3+ and PWM3- to the appropriate test pads just below the DB-25 connector.  Note that on the 2.6 and earlier boards the traces between the test pads and the DB-25 pins are really marginal for driving two light cubes, and it would be good if you would beef them up with some additional wire.You can, as you suggest, use PWM2 to drive a light cube, rather than the lasers.  To do that you need to remove R28 and put a jumper into R29, and then run wires from PWM2+ and PWM2- to the appropriate test pads and external wiring.Let us know how your mods go.-W"Where does the OpenROV cockpit browser retrieve IMU data,https://forum.openrov.com/t/where-does-the-openrov-cockpit-browser-retrieve-imu-data/4393,Add-ons / Accessories,833,Jun '16,1,Where does the OpenROV cockpit browser retrieve IMU data - Add-ons / Accessories - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,wthing,"Hi all,I am a college student working on trying to understand where the OpenROV browser UI makes a call to the Beaglebone to retrieve the ROVâ€™s orientation (IMU data).

The power supply switching happens with optocoupler OC1, MOSFET Q1, and the components in between.When a DC voltage is applied to the tether, optocoupler OC1 pulls the gate of Q1 down near ground, turning it on and allowing current to flow.  If your robot is on without power being on the tether, then either Q1 got fried somehow, there is a short on the board somewhere, or something else is pulling the gate of Q1 low.OC1 is located on the corner of the board opposite of the DB-25 connector.  Next to it is jumper slot J12, which can be used to manually turn on the robot.  As Nima mentioned earlier, there should not be any jumper soldered in the J12 position.  With batteries in the robot but no connection to the tether (the ROV should be erroneously turned on right now)  measure the voltage across the two pins of J12.  On a good robot you should see something close to battery voltage (say ~9V).

Can you remember whether the ROV turned on the very first time you put batteries in it, before you had attached the topside tether connection?Anyway, please go ahead and look at the voltage across J12.

With batteries in the robot but the USB cable disconnected (the ROV should erroneously be on at this point), measure the voltage between pins 1 and 2.

After rebooting, the voltage goes back to normal, but the camera image on the Cockpit goes black and will not resume until I reboot the ROV again.

If you donâ€™t find any issues, disconnect the four light board wires from the controller board, and start testing while you incrementally plug stuff back in.  With no wires connected, does pressing L cause the ROV to reboot?  Then just install the two wires for the lights.   Do the lights work correctly?  does pressing L cause the ROV to reboot?  Then finally reinstall the two wires for the lasers.  Do the lasers now work correctly, or do they cause the ROV to reboot?By breaking down the problem like this, you should be able to find the cause pretty quickly.Once you have dealt with the lasers issue, we can move on to the power switch issue.

The solder joints on the light board were causing shorts.,,,,,,Walt_Holm,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/fe3c"">@Fe3C</a> Good point about the light board screws, although it doesnâ€™t sound like thatâ€™s the issue here.The original light boards for 2.8 had an issue where if you tightened the camera screws too tight, it would cause a short in the wiring and could lead to power shorting issues.  This was fixed around December of 2015 with the â€œAâ€ revision of the light board (It says 2.8A on the back), which cut back the copper pour around the screw holes.  If you have an original version of the 2.8 light board, you need to be careful about either not overtightening the camera screws, or add a nylon washer or other insulating material underneath the head of the screw.

If youâ€™ve detached the BBB from the controller board, there are a number of different ways that you can power it, but a USB cable is probably the easiest.I looked at the Step 11 for the Software Update procedure.  Yes, itâ€™s a bit confusing.  Iâ€™m assuming that Brian will change it.The problem with powering the BBB with USB while its attached to the controller board is that youâ€™re putting power onto a number of lines on the controller board, without the controller board itself being powered.  The two primary areas are the UART level shifter, and the 5V input pins on the BBB.So I did some research to see what the vulnerability of both those areas are.On the BBB, there is an NCP349 input voltage protection circuit on the 5V input (the 5V input pins on the expansion headers, and the 5V barrel connector), that will switch off the input whenever itâ€™s outside the range of ~3.5V -5.5V.  Thatâ€™s good, as it means that power wonâ€™t backflow from the USB power rail to the 5V rail (and from there to the 5V circuits on the controller board) if the BBB is being powered by USB.The UART level shifter (a Texas Instruments TXB0108- part U7 on the controller schematic) is a little trickier.   Itâ€™s supposed to be able to withstand having only one side of the chip powered, but TI only guarantees this if the OE is not enabled.  Unfortunately, as soon as the BBB starts up it enables the OE pin of the level converter.  From a casual look at the datasheet, I canâ€™t tell you exactly what happens at that point.So, bottom line, what happens if you power the BBB via the USB cable, while itâ€™s attached to the Controller Board?

I have not recharged the 3.2v batteries yet, could this be due to voltage? I am surprised that the CB starts with all lights (for the first time), but absolutely no lights on the BBBâ€¦ After all, the BBB has started fine with the alkaline batteries earlier - so this is a big surprise to me.

Being a first time ROV user.  Heres the problem though.  ROV worked perfectly.  No issues at all.  Iâ€™ve been waiting on the props and finally received them today.  Installed props, turned on the unit and now the camera is freezing every time I attempt to move the camera up or down.  Also, with the divealert app installed and running I get the following error.  â€œCurrent from ESCs for identical motor operations should not differ much. This may indicate failing or a short in a wire.â€",,,,,,danmandusputer,"Looks like it freezes when the camera moves.  If left alone, there is no freezing.",,,,,,Brian_Grau,"As a first time ROV user first I would like to welcome you to the community.There are a couple of things that I can think of with regard to the camera freezing.First, there is an ongoing issue with camera in high contrast situations pausing. This same freezing has seen with complicated grid patterns (like the tiling on the sides of pools). When the servo moves the camera up or down the image can sometimes become too complicated for it to process and it has issues. If you can run the same test you have been doing where it freezes, but hold a towel or something in front to give it a simple background and not as bright of surrounding light and see if it continues to freeze.If the camera continues to freeze then it could be a mechanical issue with the wire. I have seen the white wire that connects the camera to the BBB have issues that cause the signal to drop out. If the camera continues to freeze in the above situation you can run a test on the wire. If you remove the camera from the rest of the ROV and then plug it into your laptop you should be able to view the image with a standard webcam viewer. If you play around with the wire see if the video cuts out. If it does cut out then it is more than likely this connecting wire.With regard to the dive alert you are getting - This software was written very roughly a while ago and does give useful information but it was never dialed in to exact specifications. Sometimes the alerts go off more often than they should. You should check the motors that there is nothing interfering with them. If this problem continues to persist in the water we would love to know about it because the feedback on it is good.",,,,,,danmandusputer,"So, it seems the issue is now resolved.  You were correct in your assumption about the white wire from the camera to the BBB.  I unplugged the wire from the back of the camera and re-seated it/plugged it back in.  Looks like it had come out just enough.  After doing so, the camera moves up and down without freezing.  FPS increased a little as well.  I shouldâ€™ve checked that connection to begin with.  Thanks very much!!",,,,,,Brian_Grau,I am glad I was able to help you solve your issue.

I am now confused about this process. For example, how the NCommManger â€œknowsâ€ that it should sent the command string to the CThruster2x1 but not the Clight  if the command does for the motor.(somehow like an identification check).I donâ€™t know wheather my undrstanding is proper.<br>Thanks a lot.",,,,,,charlesdc,"<a class=""mention"" href=""/u/golden"">@Golden</a>Sorry, that is likely because of how I drew the arduino side of the chart. As you have found, that function in the comm manager basically parses in a command from the serial line (or attempts to) on each update loop. Once it has a complete message, it switches that commandAvailable flag to true. The comm manager is available to all other modules in the code, so after the comm manager finishes itâ€™s update loop, the update loops for all of the CModule-derived classes get called and if they are listening for messages, they will check to see if a message was available and, if so, whether or not  the command name matches one they are interested in. The comm manager never sends the thruster messages, but rather it serves as a shared mailbox that all of the modules can check during one update loop cycle. Itâ€™s a bit inefficient as each module is doing a string comparison to see if the message is for them, and also the comm manager is spending a lot of time trying to parse strings as well, but that is what I hope to address with using a binary serialization like mavlink. With mavlink, parsing will become more of a â€œcheck the message type ID and destructure into a c structâ€ process, so everything should become integer comparisons as opposed to full string comparisons. This also should buy back cpu cycles on the BBB.Also, the reasons for why we use the shared mailbox approach are that the mcu is generally running fast enough to only have one complete command buffered at any time, so we can just process it and be done with it, and there is limited SRAM available on these mcus, so we have to be careful how much memory we allocate to making copies of messages. In our case, there is no need to send copies of messages to each module that is interested when we can just signal them to look at the one we parsed exactly where it resides in memory.",,,,,,Golden,"Thanks for such a detail reply.

I am a mentor for a team of high school students building an OpenROV for use in studying frogs in Lake Titicaca.  It is a joint project between a zoo and team of biologists in Peru and Bolivia and the Denver Zoo and St Vrain Valley schools in the US.  You can find our expedition described in the community.  The question we want to answer is â€œHow deep can we safely take the OpenROV in a freshwater lake at 12,500 feet?â€.  Our own calculations are below.  Weâ€™d like to have someone else double check them, as weâ€™d hate to have an implosion once we get down there.The OpenROV rover is designed to dive to 100M in salt water at sea level.  As such, the rover is supplied with a tether that is 100M in length.  For depth, the limiting factor is the pressure differential between the ambient air pressure at the surface of the water and the pressure at depth.  The pressure vessel that contains the electronics is sealed at the surface of the water (lake, ocean, etc.).  That effectively sets the internal pressure of the vessel (Pa, or pressure of the ambient atmosphere).  Once the vessel is submerged, the outside of the vessel is subject to the combined pressure of the atmosphere above the surface of the water PLUS the pressure due to the weight of the water column above the vessel (Pd, or pressure at depth).  At sea level, Pa is one atmosphere, or 14.7psi.  At 12,500 feet (altitude of Lake Titicaca), the atmospheric pressure is 9.16psi, or about 62% of the pressure at sea level.  This means that the pressure inside the vessel will be significantly less at our target site than it is for the normal (sea level) usage of the OpenRov.To calculate the pressure at depth, we need to know the density of the water.  The US Navy uses different densities for fresh water and salt water.  For sea water, they use 0.445psi per foot of depth.  For fresh water, they use 0.433psi per foot of depth.  The OpenROV design depth is 100M in salt water, or 328 feet.  At that depth, the pressure due to the water (Pw) is:The total pressure at depth is thereforeNow the big question.  What causes leaks to occur in the pressure vessel?  It is (we believe) seepage of the water impinging on the O-rings.  Water seeps into the gaps in the acrylic vessel until it reaches the seal made by the O-ring.  The o-ring provides a mechanical connection squeezed into place by the tight-fitting acrylic end cap inserted into the cylinder of the vessel body.  The design depth of the OpenROV would indicate that the O-ring can protect the contents of the pressure vessel up to a pressure differential ofThis equation shows that the pressure differential is simply the weight of the water column at depth. In other words, the pressure differential isIf this is indeed the case, for Lake Titicaca (at 12,500 feet) the reduced atmospheric pressure has essentially no physical effect on the pressure differential.  To determine how deep we can go, we simply need to know how deep 145.96psi is in fresh water.  That calculation is simply:So, unexpectedly for me, I find the maximum depth to be greater in fresh water at altitude than it is for salt water at sea level.  From a safety perspective, the 328 foot tether will effectively limit the rover to a safe depth.Now, I believe the math is correct, but when I double check this number against human dive tables, I find the equivalent dive depth for humans is only 210 feet.  This is directly proportional to the depth at which the pressure on the body increases by the pressure at the waterâ€™s surface (33 feet at sea level, 21 feet at 12,500 feet).  I believe this has more to do with nitrogen narcosis and the lower atmospheric pressure effects of preventing the bends than it does with the simple physics of maintaining a consistent maximum pressure differential.  However, we could be wrong.  If weâ€™re actually looking at a maximum pressure ratio (Pd/Pa), we get a much different answer (230 ft maximum depth).  This approach, though, does not seem consistent with the physics.  So, the question is, should we base our maximum depth on a consistent maximum pressure <em>differential</em> (as in the calculation above) or do we need to base it on a consistent pressure <em>ratio</em> (outside pressure to inside pressure)?I look forward to your insights and guidance, as they are most welcome.  Thanks in advance.Craig",,,,,,Fe3C,"Welcome to OpenROV!Your project sounds extremely interesting and I look forward to more updates about your progress.Your pressure calculations look correct and operation in fresh water usually allows for a greater depth, but I have some suggestions. In general these figures are very theoretical. The actual maximum depth that an OpenROV can resist heavily depends on a variety of factors, such as built quality, lubricant and sealing quality, temperature of the air inside the tubes, quality of acryl and many more. Also you have to look at a variety of different failures at depth. This can be leaks, but as you wrote also implosion. These occur at different depths for the different tubes. So overall it is quite hard to define a depth at which the ROV fails.The official 100m depth stat is a safe calculations that allows for safe operation under normal conditions. However, some ROVs have been taken significantly deeper. If you use an OpenROV that is correctly built, you should be fine with your plan.",,,,,,Eric_Stackpole,"Just echoing Fe3Câ€™s comment.  Your math looks pretty good to me but there are some other factors that need to be considered.  As an easy-to-remember rule of thumb, it just so happens to work out that in metric units, the pressure from altitude change (in air) and depth change (in water) are both very close to multiples of ten in relation to pressure: 1m of depth = ~10 kPa (~0.1 atm) of pressure increase and 1000m of altitude = 10 kPa (~0.1atm) of pressure decrease (when at non-extreme altitudes).  In other words, you can expect the equivalent of about 1m less water pressure for every 1000m altitude youâ€™ve gained.  12500ft (almost 4000m) will result in water pressure equivalent to being about 4m shallower at sea levelâ€¦ BUTâ€¦ if youâ€™ve opened or equalized your vehicle while at this altitude (which I suggest you do in order to keep the o-ring seated in the right direction so it doesnâ€™t leak when you pass through equalization at 4m depth), all bets are off.  All of these calculations assume gauge pressure, not absolute pressure.  Without the original 100kPa atmospheric pressure inside (at Lake Titicaca, the ambient pressure should be around 63kPa), gauge pressure at true depth goes back to the same value.The other points Fe3C made were also very good.  It turns out that the temperature of the water is also a major factor in performance.  I donâ€™t have empirical data for the tubes in v2.8 (which are thicker), but when I was validating the design of the 2-series, I did a series of tests to check performance of some weaker tubes we had in ice water in preparation for expeditions going to Antarctica.  The spread is fairly wide, but as you can see, the statistical difference in failure pressure between room temperature and freezing water is about 12 psi or 83 kPa.  A warm tube will have noticeably less strength than a cold one.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/original/2X/c/c76e4542b01c41b72317fa80b10e189acd7d216c.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/c76e4542b01c41b72317fa80b10e189acd7d216c"" title=""Tube Failure Data.png""><img  width=""690"" height=""399""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">Tube Failure Data.png</span><span class=""informations"">1469x850 75.9 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div>Long story short,  if you want to go deep, the best situation is to be in cold, fresh water with a carefully built ROV.Good luck with your expedition and please keep us posted with how it goes!~Eric",,,,,,Fe3C,"I can share a pressure related experience from today. I was diving at a height of 700m (see <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/monthly-expedition-day/3087/61"">this post</a> for a full report) and for some reason (excitement?) I forgot everything we talked about in this thread.I can confirm that a tube closed at sea level, will eventually pop open, if heated from inside, even when under water (very dangerous!). I was lucky enough to quickly recover the ROV before significant leaks happened. Secondly, the IMU pressure sensors is based on sea level pressure, so it has a measurement error. In line with Ericâ€™s argumentation there is an offset of about (1 meter depth measurement)/(1000 meter height to sea level). This might be useful for high altitude dives.",,,,,,Brian_Grau,"Secondly, the IMU pressure sensors is based on sea level pressure, so it has a measurement error.If you go under the Diagnostics tab there is a setting to zero the depth.

To figure out which it is, remove the batteries from Battery Tube 1 (the good side), and try to power your ROV.  If it powers up, check the telemetry for both channels, and see whether both are reading zero.

I heard the typical power up beep and the lights and lasers were flashing, but found that the cockpit &amp; dashboard would not load.After much refreshing, resetting my network settings and restarting the topside box it still would not work. I unplugged the topside box usb and ethernet cables from my computer, and strangely the ROV did not power down, the lights kept flashing, the LEDS on the control board and beaglebone were still illuminated.I waited for over 10 minutes and the ROV still had not powered down, so I unplugged and replaced the batteries. I reconnected the ROV and again encountered the same problem, cockpit would not load and ROV would not shutdown when unplugged. I replaced the batteries a second time, but when I plugged in the ROV a third time it refused to power on.I removed the electronics from the electronics tube, cleaned everything with a dry cloth and replaced them. I noticed a very small amount of condensate on electronic boards. When I plugged the ROV into my computer it again refused to turn on. I then decided to test the beaglebone alone.

The best seal is a simple one, where everything is exceptionally clean. The mechanics of the o-ring seal work best with nothing sitting between the o-ring and its sealing surface. Under pressure, the o-ring compresses and creates a stronger seal. That is why if there is dust or a scratch on a the seal surface, then under pressure water will find its way in anyway. Please<a href=""http://www.greatlakesrubber.com/oringpr.gif"" rel=""nofollow noopener""> look at this diagram</a> to see what I mean.You should have received extra o-rings with your kit, replace them if necessary.

If you do that it will attempt to power the BeagleBone through the USB +5V supply, and this will be in contention with the +5V supply on the Controller Board.  I donâ€™t know that it would do damage, but I would avoid it just to be safe.When you connect to the BeagleBone with an Ethernet cable, you still need to turn the ROV on.  OpenROV is powered by placing a small voltage on the tether, which the controller board senses and uses to turn on its power supplies.  So, to turn on the controller board, keep the USB cable running to the topside box, and the topside box connected to the ROV via the tether.  This should power on the controller board, which will in turn power on the BeagleBone.If you see power lights on the controller board, and you still donâ€™t see the controller board functioning (lasers, motors, lights, etc), then I would check the BeagleBone alignment as referred to by BrianG above.-W",,,,,,mac-p-a,"Hi guys,<br>First, I wish to thank you for your quick replies.<br>I tried everything that Walt_Holm, Brian_Grau and chanchaval suggested, with no success. I am now certain that all my wires/boards are correctly installed, as I checked all the assembly manuals and read through most of the forum posts on that subject. My problem still remains: when I try connecting my ROV through the topside box, the middle LED does not light up. Therefore, it is impossible for me to connect to the ROV cockpit.<br>Iâ€™m starting to think that my controller board is defective. No LED ever lights up on it, and even trying to install the firmware dosenâ€™t work.Is it possible that the controller board is defective? It seems to me like I tried everything.",,,,,,Brendan,"Are you using the ROV near a wifi router??? check out this thread <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/solved-cannot-connect-to-my-openrov/3854"">[SOLVED] Cannot connect to my openrov</a>",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Mac-p-a:Forget about the lights on the topside or downloading firmware for now.  Nothingâ€™s going to work until you get the controller board turned on.It is possible that it is defective, though this is not likely- every controller board gets tested at the factory, and the power switch circuitry has proven to be quite reliable.  So here are some things to try:Are your batteries fully charged?  When you examine the battery contacts in the battery tubes, are they free of contamination like epoxy, glue, whatever?Make sure that youâ€™re not putting the batteries in backwards, and that the battery tube wiring is not backwards from whatâ€™s in the instructions.If all that looks OK, set up your ROV with the clear main tube off but the controller board installed on the endcap.  Use a short piece of wire to jumper across the two contacts of Controller Board J12 (this is marked as Power Switch, itâ€™s just under the barrel connector of the BeagleBone).  Does this turn the controller board on?  If so, then thereâ€™s probably an issue with your tether wiring.Give that all a try and let us know how it goes.-W",,,,,,mac-p-a,"Hi Walt,<br>Once again, thank you for your help. I will only be able to test what you suggested tomorrow, as the ROV is at my part-time job. However, I know I double (and triple) checked the batteries to make sure they were fully charged and properly installed.<br>I havenâ€™t tried wiring the two contacts of controller board J12. I shall try it tomorrow. Say the controller board doesnâ€™t turn on, what would be the next step?<br>If I understand correctly, if the controller board turns on after this test, re-doing the tether wiring would assure that the 5V coming from the computer succesfully reaches the controller board? The controller board needs the 5v current coming from the tether to turn on. Does that mean that It can only draw current from the batteries once it is turned on?Iâ€™m a noob with electronics lol.<br>I appreciate your help<br>Pierre",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Pierre:If you short the contacts at J12 and the controller board doesnâ€™t turn on, then the next step would be to figure out if battery voltage is getting to the controller board.  You would need to get a voltmeter, and measure the voltage at the DB-25 connector J5 where the power comes in- you should find about 9.6 volts when you measure between pins 5 and 4, and when you measure between pins 6 and 7.  You can grab the schematic of the controller board on our electronics github site <a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-electronics"">here</a>.  Connector J5 is on sheet 2 of the schematic.As to your last comment, yes, the 5V on the tether throws a switch on the controller board, which then sends battery power to the processors on the controller board.  If the controller board is not correctly hooked to the tether, then it will never turn on (unless you jumper J12 as described above).Hope this helps.-Walt",,,,,,2375091759,"When I was building my 2.8, I also have troubles in connecting it.

It turns out that in the process of preparing software for 2.5, we got a bit sloppy with our revisions so it's taken us a bit of time to recover a stable version of BeagleBone and Arduino code that work together.I'm happy to say that last night, we got what seems to be a stable version of software working, so I've made an image of it which will hopefully get people with built-up v2.4 OpenROVs up and running. Conveniently, this version of software will even let you program the Atmega328 on the OpenROV Cape using Cockpit, so you won't need to pull the chip off.   If you have a 2.4, please help us test this out and let us know if it works!Here's how to get the SW running on your 2.4 OpenROV---------Applying the image to your micro SD card-----------------Step 1: Download <a href=""https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B_f6fUwp9B3kREFiM1BWNUNYQUE&amp;export=download"" target=""_blank"">OpenROV_2_4_Stable.zip</a>Step 2: (For windows) Download <a href=""https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/"" target=""_blank"">SDFormatter</a> and <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/"" target=""_blank"">Win32DiskImager</a> to your computerStep 3: Format a microSD card using SDFormatter.  ""Quick Format"" will work fineStep 4: Unzip OpenROV_2_4_StableStep 5: Run Win32DiskImager and select the image file (ending in *.img) you just unzipped.  Make sure that the drive you select under ""Device"" is the SD card you've inserted.Step 6: Write the image file to your formatted SD card by pressing the ""Write"" button in Win32DiskImager.  This process will take around 5 or 10 minuets.Step 7: Once the image has been successfully applied to the microSD card, eject the card and put in in your BeagleBone.----------------------------Connecting to the ROV--------------------------Step 8: Turn your ROV on and allow about 60 seconds for it to boot.Step 9: Make sure your computer's LAN port is set to a static IP address that looks like ""192.168.254.x"" where ""x"" is any value less then 254 and not 1Step 10: Plug your ROV into your computer, open Google Chrome, and go to the following address: 192.168.254.1:8080Step 11: OpenROV Cockpit should come up after several seconds (it may take a moment for the video to appear).  Because the Cape has not yet been programmed you will not be able to control the lights or motors, and you won't see any valid telemetry.------------------------Programming the OpenROV Cape---------------Step 12: In Cockpit, press the ""Settings"" button in the upper right-hand side of the screen, and press ""Upload""  (you don't need to select anything under ""choose file"").Step 13: A window called ""Upload Arduino Firmware"" will pop up.  Press the blue ""Apply New Firmware"" button in the lower right side of the window.  This will upload the Arduino Code necessary for the Cape to work.Step 14: Once the Arduino Firmware has been uploaded (the window will stay open, but the green progress bar will have made it all the way to the right) you can close the window.  Step 15: Restart the ROVStep 16: Once the ROV has restarted, verify that you can read telemetry data, control the lights, and control the thrusters.  You may need to program and calibrate the thrusters before they respond properly to commands.Step 17:  Let us know how it works out!-E",,,,,,Brad_Hilton,"It works!  mostly...

The same with the servo buzzing, the buzzing is when the servo canâ€™t hold the correct position, again if it is stopping and starting I suspect that the beaglebone is resetting.I would start by making sure the batteries are fully charged and that there are no poor connections (either on the D25 connector or the way the batteries/terminals are mating).  Do you have an IMU installed? If so double check the wiring as faults here have caused people a range of headaches.  If you cant find anything wrong here, removing everything bar the tether and battery connections from the D25 connector and re-test.",,,,,,masonhall,"I am having the exact same issue.

I added a small piece of paper between the tenda and the Beaglebone as a temporary solution to see if shorting was the issue. It was not. The most confusing part for me is that I was able to connect to the cockpit almost 2 months ago now, didnt change a thing, and now I cant.After about 2-3 of it not being able to connect, the servo is still buzzing and the LEDs have all started flashing at 1 minute intervals.

So there is a log file that has a lot of â€œstuffâ€ in it.  That does include the list of commands sent to the ROV, but not timestamps.If however, you turn on the data logging, <code>r</code> key, then it will record the data with timestamps to a file that can be exported.When you say you are using the latest software, is that 30.0.2 that was released last month?All of the recent firmware has a deadman switch that automatically disables the motors if connectivity to the browser gets lost for more than 3 seconds, which limits the cases where the motors could keep pushing forward.There are only three ways I can conceive that the motors would keep going if you tried to stop.The command never got sent to the ROV.  If the browser window is not the â€œfocusedâ€ window on the computer, it goes not capture the keyboard or gamepad inputs.  There are also some combinations of browser and o/s where the you have to fully release a key before pressing another for the system to register the keyboard input.  This can be seen by checking the telemetry from the â€œcmdâ€ line. It shows the last command received by the Arduino.  If you see a thro(0) then you know the stop command was received by the Arduino.  It can be hard to see this because the telemetry is only updating once a second and other commands like ping(0) can happen between the throttle command and when the telemetry updates.The Arduino died.  That would prevent it from sending the stop command to the motors.  This could happen if batteries are low.  The command comes in, the motors start which draw down the voltage with weak batteries, that causes the Arduino to shutdown.  At some point, possibly the reduced resistance of pulling the motors in to the air, causes the voltage to come up high enough that the  Arduino kicks back in and resets the motors.  This is easier to check because the runtime on the cockpit will freeze and then reset to zero.The commands that are being sent to the ROV are getting queued up somewhere.  We have seen some weird cases where the commands do get queued.  I think this is an issue that is limited to the 30.0.2 release and co-insides with a situation where the ROV will seem responsive, you still get latency graph for the connection, the the connection lights turns red and telemetry stops updating.Hope this helps give some things to look for if it happens again.-Brian",,,,,,nocomp,"thxx a lot brian for your comments,<br>so far as i remember, i had only one window and was focused, i could either go forward or back ward but not up and down, battery were fully charged.<br>i am using 30.0.0 version, dashboard says i am up to date.<br>i going to do a second dive this afternoon, i ll try to log all the data for you in case it happends again.<br>thx a lot for your time<br>best regards<br>herve",,,,,,nocomp,"hi folks,<br>second dive yesterday and finally went to the lake of annecy (supposed to be the purest lake of europe )<br>went to -6 m without any issues, except the xbox controler simply doesn t work again <img  title="":confused:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":confused:""> no idea why , any thing i can check?"BBB problem not booting,https://forum.openrov.com/t/bbb-problem-not-booting/3247,OpenROV Product Support,809,Sep '15,1,BBB problem not booting - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,globallink,"I recently updated the BBB to the latest FW and it was working fine.

When you connect the topside box, all that is doing is sending a signal to the ROV to turn the power on. This keeps your robot from draining the batteries when not in use. Typically, youâ€™ll want to keep your battery voltage level above 6.5-7V or so (canâ€™t remember the exact level). Also, you want to make sure that all of your batteries are charged to roughly the same level (within a tenth or so of a volt), so you should never have one battery at 3.0V while the rest are at 3.3V.",,,,,,badevguru,Problems by updating from dashboard in 30.0.2.

Any code that just tests the sensor only?,,,,,,badevguru,"The primary issue is to isolate the problem. Basically, if the IMU runs on a dedicated Arduino without fail that is a good data point.  If then the IMU runs with our existing software and controller board with its own dedicated power to the IMU, that would be a good data point.  Knowing if the IMU continues to respond to an I2C bus scan even when not responding correctly to the device ID check would also be a good data point.Some ideas in troubleshooting it:2a. Assume that there is something regarding the power to the device.  We know the 2.7 board has limited headroom on the 5V regulator it is using.  Could the board be drawing more power than the 2.7 board can handle?  If you have a bench supply, go ahead and power the IMU with dedicate 5V power, link the ground between the power supply the the ground off of the ROV, and see if the issue goes away.2b. Alternately, the BNO055 has low power mode options that are currently disabled, review the spec sheet and try initializing it in low power mode to see if that helps.Iâ€™ll keep thinking about it, but I donâ€™t have much else to go on without a failing device in hand.",,,,,,jamesgyoung,"The ROV completes the boot-up (beeps when powered up, beeps again about a minute later to indicate that itâ€™s ready) but beeps again about 15 seconds later for some reason. If I open the Chrome browser within this 15 second period, I see the cockpit with a heading other than â€œNâ€ and an attitude other than level. After that third beep however, the compass displays â€œNâ€ and the attitude is fixed at level. No amount of rotating the ROV causes the attitude or heading information to be displayed.If I shut everything down (including the laptop), restart the laptop, and reboot the ROV, and allow all three â€œbeepsâ€ to complete before opening the Chrome browser, I get a level attitude and a compass fixed on North. No modification of boot sequence has any effect.Iâ€™ve done all this on batteries so far, always ensuring that Iâ€™m using well charged batteries.

Really not sure what was causing this issue!",,,,,,jamesgyoung,Are you able to boot it successfully without external power now?,,,,,,stvassilev,"Hi all,Just a suggestion that following the first dive the ROV has restarted itself few times then all did start to work properly including the IMU2 sensor which we have been struggling with Nmanchovski.<br>So, I guess you should definitely get it dive then will find out whether the IMU will be working or not. It seems that nothing else fixes the problem so far. We have also connected the BB to external power supply and updated several times the software but did not work out.<br>Currently have spent  half an hour in the tube having 30.0.2 OpenROV firmware from the stable branch.<br>Everything is seems to be working properly so far. Will update  in a few days as well.<br>Enjoy your build and get it dive right away.<br>Stefan",,,,,,nmanchovski,"Hi James,yes, it works on its own, but it need one-two reboots at the beginning and a little patience.",,,,,,badevguru,"Hey guys,For anyone that is still experiencing the problem we have a couple things to explain and play with.The code for the Bosch sensor tries to talk to the Bosch, if the sensor is not responding then the system tries again after 30 seconds.  When the Bosch does respond, the code first runs the sensor through itâ€™s self test, which typically takes about 4 seconds.For the systemâ€™s that are getting a third beep, I suspect that the Bosch sensor is not immediately available after the 2nd beep (which is an intentional arduino reset).  So the system waits 30 seconds and then tries to initialize it.  As it does soâ€¦ for some reason I cannot yet explain, it is possible the self test code takes more than 8 seconds which triggers a hardware reset of the Arduinoâ€¦ the 3rd beep.One thing you can try, and I would like to know how it goes, it disabling the â€œ2nd beepâ€, which is the intentionally Arduino reset.  That line of code can be found here: <a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-cockpit/blob/master/etc/rc.local#L36"">https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-cockpit/blob/master/etc/rc.local#L36</a>To disable it you have to ssh in to the rov.  The you can use<br><code>sudo pico /opt/openrov/cockpit/etc/rc.local</code> and then you can put a Hash tag in front of the line that says <code>/opt/openrov/cockpit/linux/reset.sh</code> to disable that line. Then press control-x to exit and save.Reboot, and the system should only have the single beep on initial power up.  My hope is that the Bosch sensor is stable on initial power and just worksâ€¦ and that something about how we are reseting the system might be causing an issue.  Just speculation at this point.",,,,,,badevguru,"Interesting update. Not sure the change I recommended above actually does what I wanted.  Tried it locally and the â€œ2ndâ€ beep was still happening. <img  title="":frowning:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":frowning:"">I have a pending code update to the Arduino firmware for the BNO055 file that will remove the â€œthirdâ€ beep from the system and hopefully make a more graceful auto retry of the sensor when it has initialization issues.  Will have that posted in the next 24 hours or so.",,,,,,jamesgyoung,Thank you. Iâ€™m looking forward to getting it up and running. Any progress?,,,,,,badevguru,"Update:So <a class=""mention"" href=""/u/spiderkeys"">@spiderkeys</a> has been kicking butt characterizing the issue with the IMU.  We have been able to successfully recreate the issues that folks have seen.  If you have a 2.8 controller board, you should be fine.  For earlier controller boards, we have updated Arduino firmware code that we are putting out in a new beta release sometime this week.Going deeperâ€¦Ultimately, when we were cycling the Arduino, we had situations where the I2C conversation with the sensor can be left incomplete.  The sensor in this case is very intolerant of that and does not recover gracefully.  Those 2nd and 3rd beeps of the ROV startup sequence are restarts of the Arduino.  Given the frequency of the communication with the IMU sensor, the Arduino reset almost guarantees hanging the sensor.  Those restarts have been isolated and removed from the system.Totally geeky temporary work around to prove to yourself that your IMU works:  If you have a 2.7 controller board or earlier model with the IMU2 there is a hack to see it working while you wait for our software fix.  This hack is only good for those with the ROV running on your desk.  You can wait for the entire system to boot up, remove the power from the IMU, wait a second, and then reapply the power to the IMU and it will respond.Thanks for your patients.

It may be worth checking the individual battery voltages as its possible that this could happen as a result of dodgy cells.Beyond that, from your description it sounds the controller board is booting up fine (the blinking lights are indicating that it is not receiveing anything from the cockpit, and I suspect the noise you are hearing is the camera servo trying to hold position. both normal).  It also sounds like the beaglebone is getting power (you noted in your first post that the ethernet lights and blue leds are blinking) but failing to boot (no cylon pattern), and that the image on the beaglebone is fine.  My suggestion would be to eliminate as much as possible from the equation, disconnect the camera, switch of all the ESCs and see how you go.  If it still wont boot consider desoldering any connections other than the battery and tether connections on the D25 connector, if you still get nothing you are basically down to a hardware fault on the controller board.",,,,,,sharperct,You might try covering the Tenda board to make sure it doesnâ€™t short the beaglebone.

From the beginning we always had two issues with the electronic housing and the battery tubes. First, that the silicon lube we used was a bit to slippery so that we needed to MacGyver around to make sure the electronic housing didnâ€™t open itself. Second, that the sharp edges of the notches for the battery tube o-rings cutted two o-rings already.Understandibly I was quite jealous about the nice black straps that were added to the new version. So I started to look for a similar solution for our 2.6 model.

If you click it, it will switch to a â€œfpsâ€ viewâ€¦ which is not the frames per second of video but rather the number of latency checks performed every second.There is another counter that appears in the upper left when you press a particular key that shows fps as well.  The one that shows in the upper left is counting the number of operations our javascript timer is able to generate every second, which we target to be 33.   If it falls below 30, that fps counter indicates that the computer running the browser is having trouble keeping up.  Part of the reason it is hidden be default is that we are essentially abusing a fps counter to count something else.On the future builds, the ms counter in the lower left will no longer allow you to click on it to turn it in to a fps counter that reports useless information."[Solved] Need help with 2.6 ROV#1478,https://forum.openrov.com/t/solved-need-help-with-2-6-rov-1478/3191,OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8,1.8k,Aug '15,8,[Solved] Need help with 2.6 ROV#1478 - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TonyNJ,"We finished the build of our ROV few weeks ago, but have been having problems.After build, I had updated the BBB and then in turn the Arduino fw with package 2.5.1.30.448f366<br>Also followed the post-build checklist and re-ran the ESC calibration routine several times.When I start up the ROV I find that my vertical thruster only works in down mode.<br>My Port thruster also refused to engage in forward mode.I had initially thought this was an electrical short issue, though I found nothing.

If your zero position is faily close any you have free movement of the camera mount over the full range it should be pretty safe to increase the limits in mapTiltServo from (-0.7,0.7) to (-1,1) which should give you another 15 degrees of travel in each direction (three additional steps in each way).If you wanted to go more than this, I would carefully measure the maximal travel of the camera mount in each direction from the zero position and take the smaller of the two, subtract a safety margin (say 10 degrees)<br>and use this to calculate the max/min pulse period to be used in both locations (as well as changing the limits above).  Note: you will need to re-compile/upload the changes to the ardiuno for this to take effect.Just to re-iterate, I have not tried any of this (yet) and mistakes will likely end up stripping the gears in the servo.  Care would also need to be taken if you remove/adjust the servo at any point in the future as a small misalignment of the horn could result in the same.",,,,,,globallink,"Thanks for your answer.

Also could you check the number of steps you are getting in each direction?Steve, you can edit the source code for the arduino (controller board) that is stored on the beaglebone, but this still needs to be compiled and sent to the ardiuno (really it is just a process of uploading, as the code is automatically compiled from the source code that exists on the beaglebone).This can be done via ssh by running:<br>sudo /etc/init.d/openrov stop<br>sudo /opt/openrov/cockpit/linux/arduino/firmware-installfromsource.shI agree it would be handy to have a guide that includes some of the more common software modifications, but given the target audience would be those not familiar with linux and/or coding in general this may not be a trivial exercise.

Before I flashed my Black Beagle Bone Board with the OpenROV-flash-2.5.1-39.img, I was able to see the blue LEDs on the Blue Beagle Bone board and the lasers lit up as soon as I plug in the USB cable from my computer to the topside electronics box. After I did the flash to the Black Beagle Bone board, I saw the blue LEDs on my Beagle Bone Board lit up for a couple seconds and never came back on, and the laser light never lit up. Everything was connected the same way as before. The only light that stayed on was the LED1 on the Arduino micro controller. I could hear a humming sound from the servo when I put my ear close to the robot. So, the only delta here is the image on the Black Beagle Bone flash.At this point, I havenâ€™t received my battery chargers yet. So, it is very likely that my batteries are out of juice. I thought the batteries were only used to power the motors. Is it true that the batteries are also used to power the Black Beagle Bone board too? Thanks again for your comments.",,,,,,badevguru,Yep. The controllerboard powers the beaglebone.,,,,,,go_enigma,"You are right. It was the battery that caused the boot-up problem. I finally got everything working, but not without going through some more headaches. It turns out that my connection issue to the ROV cockpit via the Chrome web browser was caused by several things:I have VMWare installed in my computer. The VMWare software assigned an IP address of 192.168.254.1 to one of its virtual network card. So, when I attempted to connect to the web browser via 192.168.254.1, it was trying to communicate with the virtual network card rather than with the Black Beagle Bone. To resolve this matter, disable the virtual network card or assign a different IP address to the virtual network card.I have several sets of Powerline Ethernet Adapter already running in my house, before I got this ROV v2.7 kit. I learned that having several sets of Powerline Ethernet Adapter somehow caused confusion to the Tenda P200 Adapter in the ROV. So, when I try to ping it from the command prompt, it will say â€œdestination unreachableâ€. To resolve this matter, I disabled the other Powerline Ethernet Adapters that were already running in my house.So, once I disabled the other Powerline Ethernet Adapters and the virtual network card, I was finally able to connect to the OpenROV cockpit via the Chrome web browser. <img  title="":slight_smile:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":slight_smile:"">",,,,,,badevguru,[solved] Vacuum Pump Leaking,https://forum.openrov.com/t/solved-vacuum-pump-leaking/2692,OpenROV Product Support,1.2k,Apr '15,4,[solved] Vacuum Pump Leaking - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sam2,"Hello, recently I tested my seal for the end-caps with a hand vacuum pump.

When the mechanism is in ""loose"" mode, the two ends of the strap are able to pull so that the part between points (B) and (C) would be in tension if the strap were loaded. The length between (B) and (C) is what gives the strap its slack in this mode.  When the mechanism is to be put in ""tight"" mode, end (A) is folded over the rest of the mechanism and the hook there is latched around the strap going in to end (C) to keep the mechanism in that position. The excess strap coming out of point (C) will now be confined between itself and the mechanism.  With the strap adjusted properly (at attachment point (C)), the lever action of (A) folding over will cause the points between (B) and (C) to be in compression equal to the loading on the strap.I've asked a local machine and die cutting shop how much the tooling would cost to make a bunch of these out of aluminium or stainless steel, and their quote was close to $10,000.

That said, the beaglebone also has I2c capabilities and can be wired up to interface with sensors directly as well.

You can see what the existing modules are by taking a look at this:<br><a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software-arduino/blob/master/OpenROV/README.md"" class=""onebox"" target=""_blank"">https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software-arduino/blob/master/OpenROV/README.md</a>"Why does the rov run in circles,https://forum.openrov.com/t/why-does-the-rov-run-in-circles/2627,OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8,1.8k,Mar '15,13,Why does the rov run in circles - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,11110,"Hi everyone<br>Today,we let the rov run underwater.<br>We use the key â€˜upâ€™ or â€˜downâ€™ on keyboard to contral the rov running .But we found it run  in circles ,and not in a straight line.when we  using the â€˜upâ€™  key,the two motors run in same direction,and one of motorsâ€™ OARS has  different construct ,the OARSâ€™s construct is in a different direction.",,,,,,Ronald_Peters,"Are you running the 2.5.1 cockpit software?  if so, there is a problem that occurs with thruster control.  There is a â€œwork aroundâ€ for the issue.   Boot up the ROV then connect to the cockpit.  Once connected to teh cockpit, open the Diagnostics window.  After you open the diagnostics window then close it by clicking on the arrow to close.   This should correct the thruster control issue.   This is according to <a href=""https://forum.openrov.com/t/openrov-rov-suite-2-5-1-final-errants/2530"">OpenROV-ROV-Suite 2.5.1 Final Errants</a>  as posted in the forums  â€œOpenROV-ROV-Suite 2.5.1 Final Errantsâ€   Try this first and see if it clears up the problem.   Please let us know how it works for you.",,,,,,Brian_Grau,"The issue might also be that the motors are not set to spin the correct directions.

In this case, I just confirmed with the production guys that when ordering the boards without ESCs, they are shipped with a fresh atmega2560 that has not been initialized.  You have to run the following commands from the beaglebone before you can interact with the Atmega microprocessor.After running those commands you can then load the firmware.<em>edit: changed baud rate from 1000 to 10000 to correct initial post</em>",,,,,,kyledavis905,"Hey, same person you were speaking with earlier; So i ran the commands through the console in your Cloud 9 service.

I am having some wiring issues with my OpenROV 2.6.  I have observed a constellation of symptoms that hopefully makes the issue specific.  Would greatly appreciate any help on this, it is my first solo electronics project.I check the voltages on the 25-pin connector, all perfect (12 V for both power supplies, 5 V on the tether).  These are always perfect.My ESCs receive voltage (12V) on their 2 electrodes, I can tell by testing the backside of the board.  However, they display a constant red LED and do not respond to holding down the ""set"" button.I get good voltages at several points on the controller board (D11, J12, J17) but get no voltage for the checkpoints at the center of the controller board (where the comm board connects).  In J6, where the BBB connects, I get 0.8V between pins 1 and 3, and nothing else.I can power on the BBB and view the webcam when I plug the topside adapter's powercord into the BBB (powering it directly) so I don't think it is a BBB issue.While none of the 25-pins seem to short when I test with multimeter, I do see that the motor A/B/C pins all seem to be connected (shorted?).  Is this normal?  It seems like they all touch each other within the bell of the motor and it would be very hard to prevent that with the shrink tubing.Lastly, I noticed that sometimes when I power up, or toggle an ESC on/off switch, or accidentally touch two parts of the board with a multimeter probe, the ESC lights shut off and 25-pin voltage, when measured from the pin nubs on the back of the controllerboard, sinks from 12V to 2V.  If I unplug the 25-pin and test it directly, it is 12 V, but plugging it in causes a sink to 2V.  The 2V measurement on the back of the board persists even while the 25-pin plug is unplugged (capacitors discharging slowly)?  Usually if I wait awhile, I can re-plug the 25-pin and go back to normal 12V and solid red ESC lights.  Maybe an intermittent short?So to recap the observable symptoms:1)  Solid red ESCs unresponsive to set button2)  Normal voltages around perimeter of board3)  But no voltage for Comm board pins4)  And only 0.8V for BBB pins (between 1 and 3)5)  Motor A/B/Cs seem to be shorted within the motorsI have seen prior posts indicating this can be a polarity issue, I have tried switching the polarity to no avail and have measured many times.I have also seen that connecting J17 to J18 can force power to the BBB.  I do not have a J18 on this board.Thanks very much for any help!",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Jeremy:   The controller board doesn't power up until it has received a voltage across the tether.  You say that there's 5V measured on the tether, so it should be powering up.  Do any of the LEDs on the controller board light up?  If there is ~12V on the battery terminals and 5V on the tether, then the +5V switching supply should fire up and the PWR LED (green LED1) should be lit.  Shorting the pins of J12 together should also get the board to turn on.   I don't understand why you would have 12V on the ESCs if it appears that the rest of the board is off.  The ESCs do not have power routed to them until the on-board Arduino boots.  The pins of J17 can be shorted to force the ESCs to be powered-up all the time.   I would recommend downloading the schematic for the 2.6 controller board from our Github site (in the openrov-electronics category) to help you with debugging.   Other odds and ends:   The BBB is powered by 5V, not 3.3.  If you want to measure the power it's getting, that is between pins 1 and 5.  The 0.8V you're seeing sounds like leakage current through the battery-current measurement circuitry, when the board is not powered on.   J18 is one of the connections for the homeplug adapter.   The coil resistance of the motors is only around an ohm or so.  That might be why it looks like you have a short.  If you are concerned that you actually have a short, take a very careful measurement of the coil resistance and see if it is consistent from motor to motor.   Let us know how things progress.-W",,,,,,Jeremy,"Hi Walt,Thanks for your input and sorry for the delayed reply.I think connecting the J12 and J17 terminals makes sense, but when I went to try, the outer terminals all show 0 voltage.  I think my frequent handling may have caused an issue. Now I get proper 12V voltages at the 21-pin junction (as measured from the reverse of the controller board (so I know that power is going to the board), but 0 voltages everywhere else.I cannot find an intermediate measurement point between the 12V's and the 0V's to diagnose further.  Even the ESCs now show 0 voltage (note, I have removed 2 since they kept coming loose from my handling, and now only one ESC is attached to the board).Considering buying a new controller board as the issue seems to be taking place within the board (i.e. between the terminals I can measure).Any thoughts or advice greatly appreciated.",,,,,,Jeremy,"Hi guys,Update, I tore it apart and rebuilt on a breadboard with a new DB-25 to eliminate any shorts.Getting 12V for the power pins and 5 V at the tether.No LEDs turned on until I connected the pins at J12, then I got the attached image (LED2 blinks).The ESC did not turn on until I connected pins at J17.J10 now has a 5V across it, J7 has 6VStill no voltage for pin 1 v pin 5 that feeds the BeagleBone.Do you know why not and why shorting the switches at J17/J12 was necessary?Thanks again!",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"So the first thing to figure out is why the power doesn't come on when you apply power to the tether.I'd first go back and triple-check that you have the tether wired to the correct pins on the DB-25 connector.  I can't see the connections on the photo you attached to verify that.Then I'd download the schematic of the 2.6 controller board from our GitHub site, and trace the tether voltage as it winds its way to optocoupler OC1 (shown on sheet 3 of the schematic).  When you short the pins at J12, you are just bypassing Optocoupler OC1.The ESCs are normally turned on by the software running on the Arduino processor.  Since you haven't loaded any software on it yet, it won't turn on the ESCs.  Thus you have to jumper J17 to turn them on.-W",,,,,,Jeremy,"Hi Walt,Thanks again for the help.  I've made a new DB-25 and ensured that the solder connections are solid and there are no shorts.I checked the schematic and don't see anything unusual regarding the power circuit.  shorting J12 seems to work best, so I've done that.  I now get the solid green light (PWR) + solid red light (D13) + blinking red light (D49).When I attach the communication board to the control board, I also get the leftmost green light (TPWR).  The green light is solid, but sometimes goes into a blinking if I disturb the board--it is fairly fragile.My topbox has a solid green power light and orange Ethernet light as shown.I once got the HP controller board LED to turn yellow and the central topbox Connection light to also go yellow, but I can't reproduce it.I measure 4.85V over the tether.There is 12V across J11 and J17. My computer will not communicate with the box as shown.",,,,,,Brian_Grau,"Hello Jeremy,I did not read this entire string but did notice one thing that is incorrect when trying to log in.When setting the static IP address on your computer it should be 192.168.254.2 (the last 2 can be any number <strong>other than</strong> 1).The IP address of the ROV is 192.168.254.1 so you have it correct in Google Chrome.-Brian G.",,,,,,Jeremy,"Hi Brian,Much obliged for the quick response.I have tried all 4 combinations of settings and URLs, no dice.Also, I've tried directly applying 5V to BBB pin sockets 1,5 and cannot get any LED to illuminate on the BBB.

So there could be damage from that.Also, J7 has no voltage across it on the controller board, even when I connect J17 (which gives me voltage over the ESCs)As always, much appreciated for following the saga; if you asked, I would happily pay for tech support.

Iâ€™m hoping to know if Iâ€™ve resolved the issue<br>soon.<br>I bought a new Tanda set (had discarded the wall-plug parts of the first<br>ones and possibly fried them).<br>I was able to get real time camera signal by ethernet connecting the BBB to<br>a Tenda wall plug, communicate through my houseâ€™s electrical wiring, and<br>observe the ROV cockpit on my laptop (connected to the second Tenda).Therefore, it looks like these Tendas have found each other, so I expect<br>that when I swap them into the robot, Iâ€™ll get communication.Will post my findings shortly.",,,,,,Jeremy,"Bought new tendas and let them connect to each other via the wall (observed the camera by connecting BBB to one tenda, other to my laptop).<br>Then put the Tendas in topside box and on controller board<br>Now I am able to observe the realtime camera feed and even control the lights over the tether!<br>*Not sure if old Tendas were broken or if they just needed to find eachotherâ€™s IP through the wall before using.Up until this point, I had not attached the ESCs to D6-D8 and also had the wires to the motors themselves disconnected from the 25-pinI then attache the Port ESC and also connected the 25-pin triplet to the actual motor.  Using the controls, I was able to spin the propeller on command as well as raise and lower the camera.  I was drawing 0.4AHowever, then a weird short appeared.  I am using a power supply (instead of a battery, to guard against shorts).  I added the other two ESCs, turned it on and had a short (which causes the power supply to flick the power on and off as it hits and then drops current limit).  Shutting off power and turning it back on did not resolve the short, only shutting off/removing onboard Tenda/replacing onboard Tenda, caused the short to resolve.  It then started shorting after booting up, which made me suspect that attempting to power the ESCs was the problem.It seems now that when I have the ESCs in and have at least one ESC switch on, the short occurs.  If I leave all ESCs off, I can view the webcam and control the lights, but I can no longer move the camera.  Obviously with the ESCâ€™s switched off, I can also not spin the propellers.  Any of the 3 ESCs cause this short.Ligating over J17 does not have any effect; there is a voltage of 12V over it though.When I try to control the motors in any way (up down left right ctrl or shift), BTX illuminates so the signal is getting to the controller board.I have tried all of the various toggle buttons (like [ to enable ESCs)There is 12V over the ESC itself (Power and GND) and 0 V over J7 even when I try to move the propellersThe behavior is not 100% consistent.  Occassionally, I will have the system set up as described and try an ESC switch (short), try again (short), try again and get a quick burst that moves the webcam servo followed by no short.  The cockpit must then reboot because of the intial short (and generally wonâ€™t, despite all indicator lights on control board and Tenda lit), but I then get 6V over J7; still cannot use red button to program the ESC.  Drawing 0.5A.  Restarting power brings back the short.I donâ€™t see how this could be a soldering issue on the control board, all connections look good.",,,,,,badevguru,How many amps are available on your bench supply?  You need a good 1.5 to 2A to start up.,,,,,,Jeremy,"Hi badevguru,I think you nailed the issue.  My power supply can only deliver 1A.<br>I had discarded this theory because, even with all of the ESCs switched off, I could not recover the ability to move the webcam.  Similarly, I could not boot up with only one ESC on and control the propeller.However, I failed to account for the fact that on boot up, simply having the motors connected to the controller board via the 25-pin (even with ESCs off) draws current and was tapping my limit (manifesting as a â€œshortâ€)I see now that, if I disconnect the webcam ESC, and turn on one propeller, the propeller spins and 0.8A is drawn.  Easy to see how having all 3 going would send me over my current limit.Theoretically, I can switch to battery power and all will be fine.  Iâ€™m a bit concerned about frying components if there really is a short though, so Iâ€™m going to pick up some fuses first.  Iâ€™ll check the specs, but to be certain, do you know the robotâ€™s tolerance?  You said 2A on startup, but since Iâ€™m hitting 0.8A when driving a single propeller, I might need a fuse to tolerate at least 2.4A?  Maybe more?Thanks kindly for your help!",,,,,,Jeremy,"Quick update while waiting for fuses.  I was able to test each motor individually by booting up, and then selectively attaching one at a time (to keep current under my 1A power supply limit).  Each worked (with some oddities such as the starboard being unwilling to spin in reverse despite the red activator ESC light coming on for it).  Might be an issue with programming.  Good to see all are working with no shorts though, encourages me that the switch to onboard power will succeed.",,,,,,Charliemaker,"Hello Jeremy,I had a very similar issue with my Starboard motor and spent much time trying to isolate and sort out what I thought was an electrical issue.

I have just finished assembling &amp; installing the new Battery tube bracket system and I have put the entire unit back together.  I plug in (turn on the ROV to the computer USB)  Stbd thruster starts to run immediately without any control input and before the controller board even finishes booting up.  So I go back to the basic ESC programming and calibration procedures as listed in the assembly instructions (and listed below:   I start with the Port ESC. I go to the cockpit view and enter â€œdiagnosticsâ€ window.  I then Start the procedures with steps 1 thru 4 on the port thruster slider on the cockpit calibration window = nothing happens.  So I switch to the STBD slider and go through steps 1 thru 4 and the Port motor runs.   Next I go to step 5 (on the STBD) thruster slider and = the STBD motor runs.  One ESC in two different positions makes two different motors runâ€¦?Soâ€¦, next I go to the STBD ESC as soon as I turn the switch on (and the slider on the diagnostics windo is set at 0) the Port motor starts to run and the Stbd motor starts to twitch.  (again two motors affected by one ESC)  When I try to do step 5 the port engine switched direction.  When I set the slider to zero the port engine continues to run.A little historyâ€¦:   the unit functioned properly (with regard to thruster control) in previous bathtub and bench tests.   This is a totally new problem.    The only thing I did was to disconnect and reconnect the battery tubes.  I have run tests with multimeter to ensure that I reconnected the battery tube leads properly and the polarity is correct.  The telemetry, light control, camera, laser control, camera tilt servo are all functioning properly.I have also reloaded the 2.5.1 image onto the BBB.  This did not help.Anybody have any ideasâ€¦?

Your text refers to checking the calibration but nothing about checking the programming.If the ESC loses itâ€™s head and goes back to thinking itâ€™s forwards only (not forwards and reverse), then the ROVâ€™s neutral setting (1500 usec) would cause the motor to start spinning at half throttle.Soâ€¦Iâ€™d go back to the step where you <em>program</em> the ESCs, and check that the ESC is still programmed correctly.  This is a lot easier if you have a programmer card for the ESCs.If that looks OK, you might want to look at using a servo tester to see if the ESC is working correctly.  Servo testers can be cheaply obtained via Amazon.  You just plug it into a servo or ESC, and adjust the dial to get whatever speed or position setting you want.  That will tell you whether the motor range goes through reverse-neutral-forwards as it should.-W",,,,,,Ronald_Peters,Hi Walt.   You have a good point.   Iâ€™ll try to reprogram the ESCâ€™s.

Next I went to calibration as in step 97 of kit assembly guide (v2.6).  I was able to successfully complete calibration sequence on the Port &amp; Vertical thrusters. However, when I tried to do the calibration sequence for the Stbd thruster I had the following issues:   When I switched on the Stbd thruster ESC (per instructions) I got the beeps, when I pressed the reset button the beeps stopped.  When I moved the calibration slider to the +1 position and depressed the reset on the ESC I got two beeps.  I then set the slider to the -1 position and depressed the reset and got three beeps, then the motor began to run only sporadicallyâ€¦   Also - when I initially turned on the Stbd ESC,  the vertical thruster began to run and continued to run the entire time that I was trying to calibrate the Stbd ESC (note that the vertical thruster ESC was switched OFF).

The advantage of soldering the ESCâ€™s to the control board are that youâ€™ll only need to run 3 wires per thruster into the main water-tight housing, otherwise youâ€™ll need to run 3 for control and 2 for power.  The only thing I donâ€™t know is whether the OpenROV control board can handle the 30 amp load that the new ESCâ€™s are rated to.",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Kyle and Stretch:The OROV controller board definitely cannot handle a 30A load.   The OpenROV 2.7 motors draw around 7-8 amps at full load, and the board can handle a little more than that, but not much.So what Iâ€™d say is this:If youâ€™re going to run T100 thrusters using the standard OpenROV battery voltage (9.6V, a 3S configuration of LiFePO4 batteries), then you should be OK mounting the ESCs on the controller board.  If youâ€™re running at a higher voltage, say 11.1V (a 3S configuration of LiPO batteries) or 12V, then I would recommend against it.  You can do so, but realize that full-power operation of all the motors could end up melting something.-W",,,,,,Rustom_Jehangir,"I agree with Waltâ€™s suggestion here. The T100 Thrusters are sold with 30A ESCs because it minimizes heat generated by the ESCs. Even at 12V, the thrusters donâ€™t draw anywhere near 30 amps. At 9.6V they will likely draw no more than 10 amps.-Rusty",,,,,,[solved] Can&#39;t connect to openrov cockpit / &quot;Destination not reachable&quot; - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jameson,"So I just got my pre built openrov not to long ago in the mail and was going to start setting it up.

You would then need to use an SD card, burn a flash image on it, and then apply it to the beaglebone by booting with the image and waiting for the lights to turn solid indicating a completed re-write of the eeprom.If the lights are Cylon in nature, that indicated the ROV software has properly started up.

Puzzling as to <em>why</em>  the 3.3V regulator failed, though.  Thereâ€™s not a whole lot of loose wires or things to short out- itâ€™s just powering the homeplug adapter.  If the regulator failed, does that mean one of the homeplug adapters is bad?Iâ€™d proceed very carefully with the new regulator.  Keep your finger on it when you first power it on, and if the thing starts getting hot, shut it down and investigate further.-W",,,,,,geofa,"No idea why it failed, but I did replace the Homeplug board too.  Before it failed (with the old Homeplug) it would run for a few mintues then shut down - like the regulator was going into thermal overload?   At any rate, it seems to be stable now, so I will retire the suspect Homeplug adapter and stick with the new one.Thanks for your suggestion - got me on the right track!",,,,,,badevguru,Servo is activated when the escs are on,https://forum.openrov.com/t/servo-is-activated-when-the-escs-are-on/2438,OpenROV Product Support,707,Mar '15,3,Servo is activated when the escs are on - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Charile,"The servo arm on my rov is activated when the esc controllers are on.

Iâ€™d start by checking that youâ€™ve got the servo plugged into the correct connector slot (it should be in D11 if I recall correctly).When you say â€œrotates uncontrollablyâ€, what exactly do you mean?  The servo can only go so far in one direction or the other.  It shouldnâ€™t spin around in complete circles.  If itâ€™s doing this, then you have a defective servo.  Get yourself a new one off of Amazon or at your local hobby shop.If you mean that it moves too far to one side, then you just need to undo the screw that holds the servo horn, and reposition the servo horn on the servo.-W"[solved] Problem with uploading new arduino software,https://forum.openrov.com/t/solved-problem-with-uploading-new-arduino-software/2437,OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8,1.3k,Mar '15,7,[solved] Problem with uploading new arduino software - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,becker_gerrit,"hello,I have just installed the OpenROV suite V2.5.1 onto my ROV.<br>Now I am trying to upload a new arduino code onto the board as well with a few changes in the code, just to get a feeling of how to change the Arduino code.

See the diagram on Dozuki step 78.  You should be able to measure 5V where the tether connects to the topside box.   If that's OK and the unit still doesn't turn on, go back to the wiring of the DB-25 connector, and make sure that you have it done correctly.

Voltage on the batteries and terminals is good.Thanks,Joe",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Joe:   The homeplug adapter doesn't play any role in turning on the ROV.  5V is sent down the tether to the controller board, where an optoisolator sees that voltage and turns on the battery power.  You won't get a center LED on the topside adapter until the ROV turns on.  So....    Go back and carefully check the connections on your DB-25 connector.  It is very easy, and quite common, to attach the wires in a mirror image of what is correct.  If that happens, then the ROV won't turn on when 5V is applied to the tether.-W",,,,,,Joe_Cummings,"Hi Walt,I went back to the DB-25, verified the connections, verified that the port and stbd measure 12.46V &amp; 12.49 respectively at the DB-25.

I always learn more when things don't work right the first time.Any thoughts?Joe",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Joe:   If the DB-25 connector is wired right, the batteries are charged, and you have voltage on the tether, then the ROV should be turning on.  So it's time to dig in in more detail.   Go download the schematic for you controller board off of our GitHub site.  The power switching circuitry is on sheet 3 of the schematic.   Find optocoupler OC1 on your controller board- if you hold the board with the DB-25 connector on the left, it's on the lower right side of the board.  With the controller board plugged in and power on the tether, measure the voltage between  pins 1 and 2 of the optocoupler.  You should be seeing about 1 volt or so.  If there's no voltage there, then you need to trace the circuitry back to the DB-25 connector to see why the tether voltage is not getting through.

The issue you are seeing is due to the board detection system at some point trying to upload through serial (ttyO1) vs SPI (spidev).  We have an open issue on this but have not yet tracked down what is going on.  This is TYPICALLY a transient problem and cycling power should allow uploading to work again.There is a thread somewhere in the forums where someone mentioned they manually overroad the result of the board detection in the /var/run/rov_board file and changed it from cape to controllerboard.  I have not tested this but if the issue persists that *might* be worth a try.Definitely keep us in the loop!-Brian",,,,,,Eddie,"A few updates....I work with Jimmy on the rov....I changed the rov_board file to ""controllerboard"" and it appeared to work however the compileing time was very short.

Once all 3 are plugged in, I appear to have full control of all 3 motors.The problem comes when I then plug in the Camera Tilt servo into D11. At that point, some ESCs lose their programming and calibration.  Some will not respond at all while other do in only one direction (but somewhat erratically).

Have you done any more work over the last week to try to narrow down the problem?-Walt",,,,,,Adam_Christensen,"Shaun,The only way I can think you would get a response from all three motors with only two ESCs installed is if you have the wiring crossed over between motors (though without a additional short somewhere, I would have expected that all three motors would chatter at best).If you have a multimeter handy I would start by checking the wiring from the DB25 connector to the motors. Disconnect the D25 connector and measure the impedance between the three motor windings (i.e ESC1A to ESC1B, ESC1A to ESC1C and ESC1B to ESC1C) for each of the motors in turn. You should measure a few hundred milliohms in each case.  If you get an open circuit for any of them, you have a wiring problem.  Next measure the impedance from each of the motor windings (again from the DB25) to those of the other two motors, if it is not an open circuit, you have a wiring problem.Let us know what you find.Adam",,,,,,Charliemaker,"Hello ShaunApologize for the delays but time seems to have gotten away from me.

I have tried every combination of the three software files on the main OpenROV page both flashed and booted directly from the card and the only one I can get to consistently operate the thrusters properly is 2.5.1-39 booted from the card.  Anything else I try usually looses reverse on one or more thrusters either immediately or on the first reboot.  I think i am going to stick with this for now.  I have far too much time invested into trying to make this work.   Perhaps the next update will resolve our issues.Also, I noticed in your other thread that you have to hold the button down on the Beaglebone.  I don't have to do that and never have.  I thought I read on the BB website that holding down the button on boot up told the BB to copy the card to memory.  This whole thing is quite confusing to me as there seem to be muliple ways to do things and I am not sure of the positives and negatives of each method.",,,,,,Brett_Forsyth,"Hi Harry,It is my understanding that you need to hold the boot button next to the SD card to boot off the card (I could be wrong as I canâ€™t find any instructions on the OpenROV site or forums).

Much appreciation!Shaun,,,,,,Shaun_G,"Hi Adam et al!  Thank you for your responses.  Good News:Removing the DB25 and testing impedance revealed a bad wire on the PORT motor.  I replaced that wire, and now show 0.07ohms between windings on each of the respective motors.  I also found that there were no shorts between motors.---The PORT motor still chatters.  It spins somewhat more than before and responds directionally when fwd/rev commands are given.  But the chatter is still pronounced.The VERT and STBD motors work fine.---Troubleshooting further, I turned all ESC's OFF.  None of the motors worked when issued commands.I found that with any <span>single</span> ESC ON, and the other two OFF, all three motors get power. Which I thought odd.  In other words, with only one ESC ON, all three motors behave as if all three ESC's were on.  Doesn't seem right.I metered the blue OpenROV Control board at J14,15,16 and found continuity between the three ESC GND's.  I also found continuity between the three ESC PWR's.

The odd behavior when you switch only one ESC on is due to the fact that the BEC (battery eliminator circuit) from the 3 ESCs are ganged together, so that +5V power is provided to the camera tilt platform, and whatever other servos might be plugged into the controller board, if at least one ESC is turned on.  When only one ESC is on, it back-drives 5V into the other ESCs, partially turning them on.   With regards to the port motor chatter, I think you're going to have to do something to narrow down the issue to either the motor or the ESC, and unfortunately that's going to require some desoldering/soldering.  First I would go back and measure the resistances of the port motor wires from the DB-25 very carefully, using an ohmmeter that has a resolution of 0.1 ohm or better.  What you're trying to figure out is whether one of the lead wires of the motor (which is stranded) has some of it's strands broken, making the motor electrically unbalanced.  If the port motor does have some broken lead wire strands, you might want to replace the motor before the lead wire breaks altogether.   If that doesn't find anything, then take your DB-25 connector and swap the wires between the port motor and the starboard motor.  When you plug everything back together, notice which motor chatters.  If it's the port, then the problem is with the motor or it's wiring.  If it's the starboard, then the problem is with the ESC.

During my previous rounds of homework, I installed a new PORT motor.  With the trouble shooting advice from you and Adam, I was able to verify that resistance across all motor windings is the same...so all motors are good.With your latest help, I swapped the PORT and STBD wiring on the DB25....resulting in the problem switching motors.

We thought this was no problem as was mentioned in the construction guide. Well fast forward almost a year of troubleshooting this little guy for all sorts of issues, and now I think we have identified another software bug. The amount of math done against the thrusters seems to lead to problems. I think it would be simpler to just pass through the command from the Cockpit to the Arduino but I guess OpenROV have their reasons. Our latest problem is that in forward or reverse directions, one motor spins roughly twice as fast as the other. This makes flying the ROV almost impossible. By code and github issue inspection, I can see that you are doing some biasing to get a more linear response from the motors. OpenROV are already aware that this needs to be adjustable (issue #325) but another problem seems to be that this is applied backwards if the ESC is reversed in the OpenROV configuration. <a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software/issues/325"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software/issues/325</a>Here is a video demonstration.

An app note for the controller board has been needed for a while, as not that many people are good at just taking a schematic and being able to use the board for something.  The problem, of course, is that somebody needs to sit down and write that app note, and we're all busy with dozens of other projects.   As for the humidity sensor, the slot has been in there since the very first 2.5 controller boards, since we were thinking way back then of putting leak detection into the software based upon the humidity in the E-tube.  The problem is that the sensor is relatively expensive, and it didn't make the cut for inclusion into the standard production board.  It's easy enough to add yourself at home if you're handy with soldering, but you're going to have to write your own Arduino software to read it and report the results up to the BBB.  At some point we will do some more work on adding flood detection to the stock software, but its not there yet.   As  for the tweak that Brian refers to, if you look at the schematic for Controllers 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 you'll see that I grounded the mounting lug for the humidity sensor.  It turns out that the mounting lug is actually attached to the +V pin of the sensor.  So if you just mount the sensor on the PC board, you will short the +5V supply to ground.  So if you're going to use the sensor, you need to take an X-acto knife and cut the trace that goes from the solder pad of the sensor mounting lug to a nearby via, and from there down to the ground plane.    The next release of the Controller board (2.7A) will fix this issue.

Please help me solving this issue. Thank you. ",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Mohammad:   Try spinning the props with your finger (when the ROV is off) to see if one motor has more bearing friction than the other).  They should feel similar.   Also, see if the ROV goes straight when you try to turn left.  This would indicate that the left motor is spinning backwards, and needs to be adjusted in the motor calibration.Let us know if either of those things help.-W",,,,,,DiverLaura,"do you notice that it 'turns' better one way than another?  Mine turns super well to the left, and pretty slowly to the right, still not quite sure what's going on there.  Mine also has a tendency to veer left. ",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"If the props have equal friction when you spin them by hand, one other thing you can check is to make sure that there are no nicks on the propeller blades.  In our test tank we have noticed a surprising amount of efficiency difference between a propeller that has a nicked-up leading edge and one that has been carefully dressed with a jeweler's file.  It's probably not a bad idea to smooth the leading edge of the props even when new, since sometimes there's a little burr on them when they come out of the mold.-W",,,,,,DiverLaura,"my blades are fine, friction feels reasonably equivalent, the right has slightly more friction but it veers left so that means the right is slightly more powerful.  ",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hmmm.  I'm pretty much out of ideas then.  You do have the props set to counter-rotate, don't you?  That is, of the 3 props supplied with the kit, the ones installed on the horizontal thrusters should be mirror images of each other.The other thing that might be an issue is drag from the wire bundles inside the open structure of the ROV.  If you look at the ROV from the front and the back, does it appear left-right symmetrical?  There are obviously some asymmetries due to the way it's designed, but anything you can do to minimize them will help the performance in the water.-W",,,,,,DiverLaura,,,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Okay I just remembered one more thing, though this is getting into pretty obscure stuff.If the motors are handled roughly during the installation process, it's possible to break some strands of the leadwires into the motor, usually right where the shrink tubing ends on the motor side.  If enough of the wires break, this will create a higher resistance on the motor windings and cause it to lose power.You can carefully inspect your motors for this, though I wouldn't recommend removing them since that just would compound the problem.  The other way to check this would be to get a decent multimeter (one that can measure resistance with a resolution of 0.1 ohm or better), and check the winding resistance for each lead permutation of each motor (A-B, B-C, A-C).  They should all be equal and they should be consistent from motor to motor.To do this you'd have to have the E-tube open and the DB-25 connector detached, so I'd just put this down on the list of things to do the next time you have the thing open for work.-W",,,,,,DiverLaura,"I think I may have figured out the majority of my issue...  One of my ESC's was wonky (a pinched and shorting wire inside), so I replaced it and so far in tonights bathtub confined water trials it seems to be responding much better.

One of the changes in OROV 2.7 is that the ESCs are mounted, programmed, and tested at the factory, hopefully avoiding all the trouble that you've been going through.-W",,,,,,DiverLaura,"It's no real trouble, it just makes me better at fixing and troubleshooting so that i can be a better mentor for the next generation :) ",,,,,,ESC&#39;s ( thrusters) and Servo Not Working - LED&#39;s are - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nathan_Ash,"After a full day of troubleshooting, we have managed to get the ROV control systems from nothing, to communication with the computer and a successful upgrade of the Firmware to the latest version of the 2.5 BETA. We now have full control of the LED's in the cockpit for Brightness, and the webcam image is coming though, however the ESC's seem to have no power coming to them at all, and the Servo Motor for the camera is also in the same position. We are currently using a benchtop power supply for testing ( our batteries have not arrived) and when we turn the switches on the ESC's to the on position the Power supply starts flickering and saying that there is a short circuit, and when this happens the Web interface freezes and we lose contact with the ROV.if the ESC's are in the off position the cockpit seems to be sending signal to them to move., but neither the thrusters nor the Servo are reacting. Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated!Nathan &amp; Arnaud ",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Nathan:   Let's hit the camera tilt servo first.  Is the camera tilt servo plugged into connector slot D9 or D11?  The first 2.5 beta used slot D9, the latest changed that to D11 in order to work around some Arduino issues.   I think the Dozuki instructions have now been updated to reflect this.   Make sure that the camera tilt servo is plugged into the D11 slot, then let us know how things are going.-Walt",,,,,,Nathan_Ash,"Hi Walt, I changed the Servo to D11 and no change in response, bowever, i did some testing with a multimeter, and i'm not getting a voltage reading between the BEC and GND pins on any of the servo Outputs, but I am getting signal coming to the SIG pin. It seems like theres a problem somewhere along the line where I'm not getting power to that part of the board. I got to my lab about an hour ago ( I live in Atlantic Canada and this OpenROV is to be used for a geography Research Project), and i'll be here all day testing. I suspect if i can put 5v to the ""BEC Power"" pins on the board I might be able to solve part of my issue. NathanNathan",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Nathan:     Good problem description- here's what the issue with the servo is:Normally the servo gets powered by the battery eliminator circuit (BEC) that exists in each of the 3 ESCs.  They feed +5V power back onto the BEC bus, which then powers the servo.  If you have all the ESCs turned off, since you're having issues with them, then there is no +5V power being generated for the servo.The ""BEC Power"" pads exist to allow somebody to use servos with this Controller Board in a design that doesn't have any ESCs, and therefore doesn't have a BEC to provide power to that buss.   Apply 5V to those pads, and you should have a working servo.Once you verify that the servo is working, we can turn to the ESCs, and once you have at least one of those working, you won't need to apply power to the ""BEC Power"" pads any longer.Walt",,,,,,Nathan_Ash," Hi Walt, So, A lot has happened today. First of all: the Servo and ESC's now work! The initial issues were due to my Bench top Power Supply that I was using for testing ( our batteries are not in yet) was in the wrong setting, as soon as I changed it to parallel mode they all worked! That said, we are now in a slightly different position, first of all, the camera doesn't want to start up ( i.e. send data to the Cockpit) when the ESC's are in the ""ON"" position, I need to turn them off, power up the board and cockpit, and then turn on the ESCs, then it works. And there is also another problem. Our Beaglebone has suddenly stopped working, and refuses to boot. the Power LED comes on, but the USer LED's do not. We are in the process of trying to re-flash the Microcontroller with the base software from Beaglebone, and then try again from scratch in an attempt to bring the Beaglebone back to life. If you have any suggestions or help in any of these issues that would be great! Thanks for your help so far, it's been quite useful!Nathan",,,,,,Cannon_Cottle,"One of the issues I had early on with the camera not booting was that it wasnâ€™t getting enough initial power to kick over. This was fixed by just swapping out batteries.I donâ€™t have anyone else other than the forums helping me along with this, so this may be dumbed down advice for you, but when you do calibrate the escâ€™s make sure you remove the camera servo jumper. If you donâ€™t the escâ€™s go insane. This may be dumbed down advice or something you already know, but it took me a weekend and a fresh look at the ROV to figure it out.Good luck",,,,,,Nathan_Ash,"I have some expertise here at my disposal, but im more so supposed to be the SME for the people from Geography for whom I'm helping assemble this ROV.My biggest frustration currently is that we don't have our batteries yet. We are in Canada, and its not easy to get the 3.7volt Lithium Ions into the country. they should be here sometime next week. because of that were just using a benchtop supply. Initially power was my issue was well, prior to me being able to get the ESC to start up at all. I had to put my benchtop supply in parallel. when it comes to calibrating the ESC's, people have mentioned this numerous times on this forum, and I ( to my knowledge) never completed this step. I don't know if it happened when I was trying to solve some other issues we had and was bench testing just the controller board with the ESC's on it, but I haven't had any problems. all of my thrusters respond correctly to the inputs as I give them from the software. what should happen when I calibrate them? I don't know if that's been added to the assembly instructions since I last looked at them or not. Thanks for your help on this! it's nice to know someone somewhere else has reproduced the same situation as me, means that its likely not something I managed to break something, and more like there is a simpler fix out there somewhere!Nathan",,,,,,Cannon_Cottle,"Calibrating the ESC's wasnt in the instructions I had for the 2.5.  I came across that on the software release page of Github.  <a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software/releases"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-software/releases</a>but I assume you have already found this.  In my experience before I calibrated the ESC's, when I turned on the ROV some of the motors would engage intermittently.  Calibrating them killed this problem and helped them know where zero input was.  Batteries were also a pain for me.  I had never seen this size of battery, but thankfully Amazon had them.  Cannon",,,,,,David_Lang,"Yes, Amazon is currently the best place to find them.<br><br>",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Nathan and Cannon:   I've been away from the forum for a couple weeks, and am trying to catch up now.  I can sympathize with the challenges you're having with the power supply.   One thing you can try if you think you're having bootup power supply issues is to turn the ESCs off while sorting out the other problems.  The ESCs in the kit draw a truly massive current spike when they are first turned on, for I think maybe 10 usec or so.  I'm guessing it's a bug in the ESC firmware (probably the output MOSFETs are all turned on at the same time) but I don't know for sure.  Anyway, this current spike can't really even be handled properly by the lithium cells, and it kicks off the 5V switcher for a short period of time.  The reason the output of the 5V switcher has such a huge capacitor on it is to hold up the 5V bus while the ESCs sort themselves out, and the 5V switcher comes back online.  In time we will likely switch to a different ESC that doesn't have this ""feature"", but we've got bigger fish to fry right now, so that task is on the back burner.If the external power supply you're using can't source as much current as the Lithium cells do, then it may be that the cap on the output of the 5V switcher can't hold up the +5V bus for the length of time that your external power supply needs to recover.  If that happens, the Arduino tries to reset everything (including the ESCs), and the whole process starts all over again.Nathan, If you still have issues finding lithium cells in Canada, you could modify the unit to run on 8 or 10 NiMh C-cells, with 4 on each side, or 5 on each side if you cut yourself some longer battery tubes.  The wiring harness would then need to be changed to hook the battery tubes in series.  We want to test this configuration here at the lab sometime, but again it just hasn't bubbled up to the top of the priority list yet.Anyway, I hope this explanation at least gives you some background as to what might be happening.  Please keep us posted as to how things progress.-Walt",,,,,,Nathan_Ash,"Walt, Thanks for your help! From reading your post I can  say that the issue is likely due to power, and once we get our lithium cells in from what you're saying we shouldn't have any problems. Our cells are on their way, finally in the country (they had to come shipped from china) and should be here early this week! I'll make sure  a post with some pictures will be up once we have a successful test!Nathan",,,,,,Thomas_S,"a cheap solution to provide enough power (before recieving the batteries) could be to use a ATX powersupply from a computer.these have ALOT of amps available on the 12v output.the power supplies has 12V on the yellow wire going to the various devices.with the power supply standalone, it can be turned on by jumping a wire between the green wire and a black wire on the 20-24pin atx connector.guide: <a rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-power-up-an-ATX-Power-Supply-without-a-PC/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-power-up-an-ATX-Power-Supply...</a>if you want a permanent bench supply you could follow a guide like this and have various voltages available for testing of electronics.<a rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-a-Computer-ATX-Power-Supply-to-a-Lab-Power-Supply"" target=""_blank"">http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-a-Computer-ATX-Power-Supply-to-a-Lab...</a>",,,,,,DiverLaura,"I am running a total of 10 (5 on each side) 1.2v 5000mAh Rechargeable NiMH cells.

I'm using rechargeable due to the high draw of the motors and as was explained to me, non-rechargable have too much resistance - plus I'm taking the ROV out every day or so, which would be way too many disposable batteries. ",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Laura-   I was interested to see in your videos the changes that you had made from the stock ROV, but curious as to your rationale for some of them.   Here at OpenROV HQ we've been using rechargeable 26650 LiFePO4 batteries for the last 9 months or so, and are very pleased with their performance.  Compared to NiMH, they have better energy density, so for a decent battery pack capacity you won't need to use flotation on the ROV to get the buoyancy right.    If you decide to stick with NiMH for future builds, here's a couple of thoughts:- 12V is not needed to run the ROV.  The recommended LiFePO4 battery configuration is 9.6V.  If you use 4 NiMH batteries per side, that would match it at 9.6V.  You'd have less energy available, but also less need for flotation.- Since the NiMH cells are all placed in series, the total vehicle current draw goes through a single set of wires to the electronics tube.  I would consider upgrading the wire for the battery pack from the 20ga supplied with the kit to 18ga.- Similarly, when you bring the power into the vehicle through the endcap and the DB-25 connector, make sure that you bridge the power across both sets of power pins in the DB-25 connector.  The power pins in the DB-25 connector, and the associated blocking diodes on the controller board, are not sized for continuous full-power operation from a single channel.  With the Lithium batteries, the current gets split between two separate channels.Keep posting your videos.

There have been two official changes to the OpenROV 2.6 kits and assembled units that are purchased through our webstore. I'd like to take a second to explain what changes were made, why, and how you can also make these changes.<img  width=""600"" height=""400""><br>Affects OpenROV 2.6 serial numbers 1400 and above.First off, let me start by saying that we at OpenROV HQ had the pleasure of having some amazingly smart and talented folks here over the summer as interns. Most of the changes featured in this post as well as some of the cool things we are planning for the future builds on their hard work, intuition, and enthusiasm. I will credit them, and the work of others where I can.The first change was started at the beginning of this year when one of our stalwarts, Walt, was trying to figure out a way to spend less of his time holding the ""up"" and ""down"" controls through deep dives that required long ascents and descents. His efforts along with no small amount of ingenuity on the part of Laughlin led to the development of a test for better, more efficient and powerful motor and propeller combinations. Through the hard work of our interns, Kevin and Zoe, we've arrived at a solution.<strong>Change #1:</strong><strong>Vertical prop is now a <a href=""http://shop.graupner.de/webuerp/servlet/AI?ARTN=2303.57"" target=""_blank"">Graupner 2303.57</a></strong> <strong><span>57mm racing prop</span></strong>The Graupner racing prop is significantly more powerful while still being efficient. This will allow drivers to dive and surface much more quickly.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3400/6e9d7b7cd83c9732.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/2f84d75d255a466902638aec6459dc424af48c24"" title=""60-IMG_20140915_111332665.jpg""><img  width=""281"" height=""480""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">60-IMG_20140915_111332665.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">2432x4320 2.37 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><br><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3401/f57656ee061eee12.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/e6837f517b4cc032e3d399a4544f35c2521c67bf"" title=""62-IMG_20140915_111314856.jpg""><img  width=""640"" height=""388""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">62-IMG_20140915_111314856.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">4320x2432 2.6 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><br>Seen above are the three props now included with the OpenROV kit and fully assembled units. From left to right: Graupner models 2308.65, 2303.57(new), and 2308.65L (the L is for 'left hand rotation').If you are having similar issues with deep dives, changing the props is simple enough. The 2303.57 can be bought on several webstores (even amazon.de), most of them in Europe. Modification to old ROVs is easy, as you simply need to break off the old prop and epoxy this one on. If you are having trouble sourcing the 2303.57, other sizes of the same 2303 family behave nearly as well and can be used as a substitute. Lastly, keep the c-clip from your motors, because these puppies are powerful enough to pull the bell right off the motor. If you've already tossed those in the bin, you can buy the part from the all-powerful McMaster catalog <a href=""http://www.mcmaster.com/#98408A116"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>. Check out the <a href=""http://openrov.dozuki.com/Guide/How+to+Assemble+OpenROV+2.6/6"" target=""_blank"">2.6 Dozuki</a> for instructions for further information on this.The second change has been part of an ongoing feedback loop from our user base and community. We've seen lots of leaky battery tubes. Some of this is due to the forward battery tube endcap becoming dislodged or having a small leak that only occurs at depth...then on surfacing, the air pushes the cap out.<strong>Change #2:</strong><strong>Larger diameter o-rings on battery tube endcaps</strong>To help this, we are now using the larger #314 buna-n o-ring. To accommodate this, the acrylic parts to the endcap have also changed. This allows for a much better seal both initially and in shallow waters and at depth. We are hoping to get as much feedback on this as we can in the coming months.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3402/5da83cac73c2dc48.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/0830809f5f9cbe1c216bc136206389eadda62a41"" title=""64-IMG_20140915_112444727.jpg""><img  width=""640"" height=""388""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">64-IMG_20140915_112444727.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">4320x2432 2.56 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><br>You can see the new, larger diameter o-ring endcap on the right.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3403/028bcffb0c0d9293.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/b00d9f69fa1ba06005d3fbbd2d696c378b9ce2a2"" title=""66-IMG_20140915_112509670.jpg""><img  width=""640"" height=""388""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">66-IMG_20140915_112509670.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">4320x2432 2.66 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><br>The larger o-ring engages with the sides of the tube much better, which hopefully will reduce leaky endcaps.Upgrading your old endcaps would be recommended if you are having consistently leaky battery tubes.

Â If you still have the building bug after your ROV is ready to go, check out the <a href=""http://openrov.com/forum/categories/payloads/listForCategory"">Payloads section on the forums</a>Â and see if you get any ideas for cool things to add to the ROV (suggestions also welcome!)Our dream with OpenROV is to make it so that anyone can be an explorer. Â  There are endless adventures to be had and discoveries to be made beneath the waves, and we hope that by making technology to explore the deep available to everybody we can learn a little more about our incredible planet.Have fun, learn a lot, and explore the unknown!",,,,,,Ron_Sindric,WOW !!!

All of these is not possible for an Ardunio.I'll buy the shell only and then will try to make it work (maybe writing a different firmware) with arduino alone",,,,,,David_Lang,"Cool! That'd be awesome, Simone. <br><br>We had a really hard time getting ahold of one which is why we've been pushing ahead with the Beaglebone. ",,,,,,David_Lang,"We're always looking for solutions to go ""Cheaper and Deeper!"" ",,,,,,Simone_Chiaretta,"yeah, difficult to get them :) mine is scheduled to arrive for mid-August (waited 3 months before being able to pre-order it).But from what I've read around, even with RasberryPi you need a cape/shield since the GPIO doesn't have PWM and analog input.The ardupilotmega from DIYDrones is also another options, but more expensive and not so general purpose. But it's superlight and small (even if probably underwater this is not that important as in the sky).",,,,,,Eric_Stackpole,"The circuit we're using for the BeagleBone Arduino Cape will (of course) be completely open hardware as well, so I wonder if someone savvy with PCB layout could make a version that would fit onto a Raspberry Pi.  We're still catching up with the documentation, but here's where the current files can be taken from:<a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-electronics"" target=""_blank"">https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-electronics</a>As for the Ardupilotmega, I think it will have the processing power, but it doesn't have the USB host and Ethernet capabilities that are really pretty principle to what we're doing.  All the same, it's always nice to see if people can find alternate ways to do things.E",,,,,,Stephen_Ford,"Raspberry Pi seems to be in conflict with the intended ""open source"" ideology of this project. The bone does have hardware PWM and components useful for sensors and other forms of data acquisition. I hope the project stays focused on the open-source mandate...",,,,,,Simone_Chiaretta,"Stephen, why do you say that Raspberry PI is not in line wth open source idealogy? Also the BB is not open hardware.<br>And to my understanding, both BB and R-PI have the same type of multi-purpose connectors, and for both you need a cape to be able to send PWM or to read sensors.",,,,,,Stephen_Ford,"<span>The Broadcom BCM2835 chip is not fully documented and from my understanding will not be. The exposed pins are, but the inner workings of the chip itself are not. The Bone on the other hand comes with the TI <span> sitara AM3358/9 which comes with a 4600 page datasheet detailing all aspects of the chip including the mux of the pins exposed by the cape. Granted some of the peripherals information is not easily available. But, with an open source Linux kernel and a fully documented processor. It is far less constrained. I find the raspberry pi to be an excellent device, don't get me wrong. I however believe that within an ""open"" style development, the bone has far more potential. </span></span>",,,,,,Simone_Chiaretta,The PI runs on Linux as well... anyway after a bit of thinking probably the PI looks more targeted to interactive usages (comes with audio and video connectors on board) while the bb looks more like a embedded developer platform. Too bad it costs 3 times the Pi :),,,,,,Simone_Chiaretta,"On the other hand, by using a Pi, the project would probably get more mediatic exposure :)",,,,,,Stephen_Ford,"I would agree with almost everything you say, except the targeted usage. HDMI is not going to run very well over a 28 gauge twisted pair tether that is 60+feet long. The BB is a pretty good I/O platform. The Pi would be very well suited to the surface interface communicating with the Bone over that tether and outputting the media for consumption.  ",,,,,,Simone_Chiaretta,"Exactly, I didn't mean HDMI to send the video of the ROV :) I meant it as media center, or interactive display: a product closer to the end-user than to the developer",,,,,,Stephen_Ford,"The really cool thing is the recent announcement that Android is coming to the Pi. I've done a few projects using Android phones as the interface to a BB over sockets. Fast, reliable and relatively simple. Gonna have to get me one of these things. See if the girl friend will up my toy allowance!!",,,,,,Simone_Chiaretta,Me I'm still 8 weeks away from delivery of my Pi,,,,,,Craig_French,"OLinuXino could be an option to consider, its hardware &amp; software are completely open-source; may be a good choice for DIYers, compared with Rpi &amp; Bbone.",,,,,,Scott_Kellie,"Looking at this project has stirred my inventiveness.

Only plug all three into the controller board once you have all three ESCs programmed and calibrated.  This should eliminate the issues you're seeing.-W",,,,,,Endre_Moen,Thanks for the tips!

If you have an OpenROV 2.6, see Dozuki step #92.

Will do.,,,,,,Hubertus,"Hi Brian<br>Yesterday I tried master 44. the upload of the Arduino software was much faster, which made me happy. I had to reboot several times however to get everything to work. After each boot something else was working or not working (for example motors respond to sliders in diagnostic, but not to keyboard or gamepad, yawing left used both motors, yawing right only one and so on) Hard to understand.<br>Another observation I made was that the imu-functions were rotated by 90degrees. So if I lift the front, the cockpit shows a tilting sideways. Is that a bug or did you intend to mount the imu 90degrees rotated? (Its like using microsoft products, you never know wether its a bug or a feature) <img  title="":wink:"" class=""emoji"" alt="":wink:""><br>Thanks for all your work!!!<br>Hub",,,,,,Mike_Sinclair,"I uploaded master 48 this morning.  It addressed the firmware upload. :) Like Hubertus mentioned, the IMU functions are rotated by 90 degrees.While testing/configuring, I noticed there seems to be a lag between pressing buttons and having a response from ROV. It looks like the cpuUsage is 1 or very high. Sometimes the motor stay on after I stop pressing the arrow keys. I'm assuming it is because the CPU is busy and not seeing the key-up.I disabled the head up menu hoping to free up resources, but it didn't seem to do too much. Are all of these features/plugins putting too much strain on the BBB? Any other things that can be done to improve performance?",,,,,,badevguru,"Hey Mike and Hubertus,Glad it is working.  The CPU utilization is driven primarily from the USB not being interrupt driven on the version of the Kernel we have used. We are testing the upgrade and hope to release it soon.In the meantime, you can lower framerate on the video if CPU becomes a big problem.As far as the IMU goes, yes, it is currently askew in the dev image.  Will be sorted out soon.",,,,,,badevguru,[Solved] Issue with Camera,https://forum.openrov.com/t/solved-issue-with-camera/1180,OpenROV Product Support,728,Sep '14,6,[Solved] Issue with Camera - OpenROV Product Support - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Salman,"Hello guys,I have an issue with streaming the video.

Also, Depth sensor used to work, but after the calibration it doesn't !Regards,.",,,,,,David_Murphy,What are you using for your power source?You need at least 9-12V and 4 amps of current capacity to run the ROV.,,,,,,Salman,I am using 11.5 V / 4 Amps ! but still dunno what's wrong ! batteries are fully charged as well,,,,,,David_Murphy,Calibration of ESC's should have nothing to do with the camera working or not but because you say the camera works if the esc's are switched off indicates to me that you have a power issue. You can try switching on only one esc at a time to see if it is one particular esc that may be causing your issue.,,,,,,James_Sullivan,"Double check your wiring, also for shorts on the 25 pin connector.Hope this helps.James",,,,,,Salman,Thank you very much David and James.

I received the kit around July 15th so I *think* the latest firmware is already loaded and I should not need to load from a SD card or get new firmware from GitHub (which seems to be from Open ROV 2.5 anyway).Problems:Thanks in advance for any assistance.Jeff",,,,,,badevguru,"Re #2: Can you ssh to your ROV?

Is your computer reasonably powerful? or is it the old computer you are not worried about getting wet? :) I read some where that you can lower the video resolution if you are using a slower computer. hope that helps",,,,,,Jeff_Hughes,"Hey guys, thanks for the suggestions so far. They've been helpful.Last night I decided to try booting the ROV again and this time it worked. This was with the electronics just sitting on my workbench (not encased in the clear PVC container). This time the ROV booted up. At that point I reloaded the firmware and again the ROV booted up and the camera was correctly showing a video image. Then I slid the electronics back into the clear PVC electronics container and put the caps on both ends. At this point I noticed that the video image was frozen and that the controls would not work. The ROV software was essentially hung.It seems like there are a couple of possible causes. First, the white wires that run to the DB25 are just long enough to reach, so they are pulled taught when I put the boards inside the PVC tube. It is possible this causes some of the pins on the DB25 to touch together and short out some connections. The other possibility is that the board is flexing just a small amount when I put the whole thing inside the PVC tube, again causing some kind of hardware issue. Keep in mind that this all worked the day before, so I'm just speculating as to why it would have stopped working when I put the electronics back in the tube.Anyway after that event I took the electronics back out and set them on the bench again. Tried to reboot a couple of times but no luck. Then downloaded new software per Darcy's suggestion and rebooted from the SD card. Still no luck. Downloaded Putty and attempted to connect via SSH but again no luck.When I boot up the lights on the topside board seem to do the right thing and the lights on the arduino board also seem to do the right thing - although it's tough to know for sure. I thought there used to be a blue LED somewhere under the beagle board that would light up during the boot sequence and I don't see that anymore. If I let everything run for 5 minutes or so I notice the middle yellow light on the top side board goes out and the TPWR light on the arduino starts flashing 1 second on then 4 seconds off (repeatedly). So that's not right.Are there diagnostics I can run to verify the hardware? Any suggestions??",,,,,,Jeff_Hughes,"This problem has mostly been resolved. My BBB died and I replaced it with a new one. I've been able to connect to it via Chrome and also via SSH. There is still a problem whereby the latest ROV firmware will not bootup when loaded on an SD card, but I'm going to post that as a separate thread.

Also the tape is silicone and seals with the o-ring quite well.,,,,,,quantumquark,Great suggestions walt.  David asked that we post other tips here as well.  Tip is for Soldering the <strong>Topside Tenda Home Plug Adapter</strong>1. put hot glue on the backside of the header pins prior to solderingThe hot glue helps dissipate the heat from soldering and prevents the header pints from breaking free of their mounting.  I am a novice at soldering and these pins popped loose during soldering causing all my intermittent communications problems.  I got a new Tenda adapter and used the hot glue technique and it worked!,,,,,,quantumquark,Great tip Walt!  Also on the 2.5 kit if you cut the pins too short you can remove the black spacer with needle nose pliers easily giving you enough pin to solder to.  I found it difficult to re-solder these pins mine wouldn't bond to the board it was like I was stripping off the layer it mounted too.  I found that putting a dab of hot glue on the back side of the header pins prior to soldering would prevent them from breaking free.,,,,,,quantumquark,I did this too!  Works great!  Too bad the COB causes the batteries to be in the view as well.  I painted the tops of my battery packs black to reduce glare at night.  When looking at objects in the distance (at night) the auto-exposure tends to reduce brightness (and contrast) because of the battery pack glare.  When you get close to something the lights light it up enough to tell the auto-exposure to change settings to see the scene.  If the view is too dim the presence of the battery packs actually reduces visibility because of the glare.,,,,,,quantumquark,Could just epoxy them on as part of the build.,,,,,,Walt_Holm,Do you have a link for this silicone tape?-W,,,,,,Dave_Hinton,"Hi allDavid Murphy commented on the problem with the teather on the sea of Cortez video.

I think I will add the acrylic cement to the other end cap to build up some confidence.

The spring is quite strong, so the battery caps don't fit all the way in, even with the large o-rings holding them in place.

It should. It's almost the exact same as the v2.5 kit. We had to make slight changes to the controller board due to to manufacturing changes of the Tenda homplug adapters. We struggled with whether to even call this another version, but decided it would probably be worth it. We also made some changes to the inner acrylic assembly (to make it easier to build). As well as making the end caps more robust (we'll have end cap upgrade kits available very soon for anyone who wants to make a change). And now the BeagleBone Black ships with OpenROV software loaded onto it! Just plug it in and go.If you purchased a kit after December 16th, you've atually already been sent an v2.6 kit. There are a few changes to the assembly instructions, and we'll have those up on Dozuki very soon. (It's close enough that you'll very likely be able to figure out how to do it yourself.)Let me know if you have any other questions!",,,,,,Joel_Kjellberg,"Do you plan to post a guide or something on how to overcome the problem with the 2.5 controller board and the v.2 tenda homeplug adapter? I bought all the parts independently, but I can not assemble them right now due to this problem.",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Here's some background information for those who are curious:   The change from 2.5 to 2.6 was forced by the discovery (by somebody on the Forum) that the design of the Tenda HomePlug adapters had changed, and that the Tenda Revision 2.0 adapters would not fit on the V2.5 OROV Controller board.  Yikes!  Some quick E-mails to our Tenda rep revealed that yes, the design had changed, but somehow he hadn't notified us of this.  We had some discussions here at OROV HQ whether or not to try to buy up a big stock of the old Tenda V1.1 adapters, since production and sales of the current ROV design were in full-swing, and we didn't want to perturb that.  But after some head-scratching, we realized that we could modify the design of the Controller Board so that it was compatible with both the old and the new Tenda adapters.   So, off we went, updating the design of the electronics.  The controller board schematic stayed mostly the same, but the layout of the central portion of the board changed significantly to allow the new adapters to plug in, while still keeping the pads for the old adapters.  On the Tenda V2.0 design, the LEDs are on the power board rather than the logic board, so, since the ROV doesn't use this power board, we had to add some LEDs to the Controller board to show the status of the Homeplug adapter.  We rolled a couple of other updates into the board as well- the holes for mounting the ESC power leads were opened up just a touch, there was some filtering added to the ESC current monitors, and the BB Cape ID EEPROM was added back in, in support of future auto-ID software.    In the end it all worked out OK- the boards are stuffed in a configuration where the Tenda V2.0 adapters plug right in, as before.  If you have an old V1.1 adapter, you can still use it, but you have to unsolder a couple of headers, and stuff in a couple of sockets.  The new LEDs work well at allowing you to see the status of the HomePlug adapter from outside the ROV.  The 2.6 controller boards are 100% software-compatible with the old 2.5 controller boards.   The change in HomePlug adapter boards forced our hand in redesigning the top-side adapter as well.  A number of folks had had problems putting together the V2.5 topside adapter, so, since we needed to build something with LEDs to display the topside adapter status, we decided to put together a complete board that eliminates all the soldering and fussing involved with putting together the topside adapter.  This new board has a voltage regulator as well as the 3 status LEDs for the HomePlug adapter, and the tether connection is now made through some spring terminals rather than screw terminals.  The Tenda HomePlug adapter plugs into this board similar to the way it does on the controller board.  There's no soldering of any kind required.   So, while all this was going on, we were digesting the results of the open-water testing from Lake Tahoe in late October.  The biggest takeaway was that our current main endcap design was just too twitchy for long-term use.  The manufacturing tolerance stackup between the acrylic tube and the laser-cut endcaps was too wide for the O-ring to handle, even after fussing with Teflon tape, latex balloons, and the like.  So Eric bit the bullet and redesigned the endcaps, changing the layer stackup in a way that allowed the O-ring to be greatly increased in diameter.  There were also some changes made to the location of the wiring channel, that increase the strength of the endcaps.   The final changes that were made to OROV 2.6 involved simplifying the internal structure of the ROV.  Some areas that required doublers of 1/8"" acrylic were changed to a single piece of 1/4"", which is significantly stronger, as well as not requiring any build time.  The position of the motors was moved a bit as well, to try to improve the balance and the driveability of the ROV.   So, the 2.6 unit is easier to build, and more robust. What more can you ask for?   One of the objectives for our recent trip to the Sea of Cortez was to give the OROV 2.6 vehicles an extended test in sea water.  More on that in some future blog posts, but the main thing we found out was that the new main endcap design is massively better than the older 2.5 design.  So much so that we'll be offering new endcap kits to allow people to upgrade their older endcaps to the new style.  No teflon tape, no latex balloons, it just pretty much works.-W",,,,,,Walt_Holm,"Hi Joel:   Once we get the schematics for the V2.6 controller board posted on GitHub, you should be able to decipher how to wire the new HomePlug boards into the old V2.5 controller board.  If you don't feel comfortable with that level of electronics tinkering, I'd drop an e-mail to David and discuss your options.  There may be some V1.1 Tenda adapters being kept around OROV HQ as spares, or there may be a way you can do an exchange of your old V2.5 controller board for a new one.

We're working around the clock to update the instructions and many of your questions will help us formulate a better how to.  A few quick answers to keep you going while we build better instructions:1. We've got this, currently its step 46.2. Currently we're still working this out...I know this is really sloppy...but very soon we should have a step or two on this.  Stay tuned!3. Flat edge down towards the battery tubes.  Definitely we're going to add a step about this.4. Straight forward.  If the servo arm has been centered (see dozuki on this...we just added a diagram) then you can tilt up then down with the cockpit.5. Done correctly, it should just be the length needed to the epoxy with a little extra...pushing the endcap on should be all that is needed.6. We're going to add a step and a video soon but until then check the wiki here <a href=""http://wiki.openrov.com/index.php/Programming_the_ESC"" target=""_blank"">http://wiki.openrov.com/index.php/Programming_the_ESC.</a>7. We've made a change to include this.8. The plungers allow you to close the tube without creating a positive pressure.  Put the endcap in, the the plunger.  The Dozuki will be changed to include a step about cutting them to length to fit within the shell.9. I would probably solder on a conductive metal washer...this is the first we've heard of this...interesting.  Please let me know if this is still a problem.10. The magnets are strong enough to hold the motor bell rotor onto the stator for sure.  Make sure it engages fully (meaning-its pushed down all the way).11. Yes, but hot glue the ends to prevent hosing.12. Haven't tried this yet.  In theory, yes you can make it shorter.13. We will be updating the dozuki constantly.14.

So far it has gone fairly well, a few times I've scratched my head, but after all things have gone fairly well up to now.Just opened the package, lot's of fun awaiting :-)Assembled the thruster motors and battery tubes.Assembled the electronics!Installed the IMU/Depth Card.Now I just got to figure out the software part...And let there be light!Still have some work to do, still waiting for the epoxy to arrive in the mail, but we're getting there :-)Next step is-Fine adjust the lasers.-Configuring S/W for IMU/Depth card. -Epoxy the end caps and battery modules.-Try and sort out internal layout inside electronics module, it is a tight fit, and the push from the wires from the 25 pin is pushing the camera hard against the front of the glass. This does the servo no favours since it has to work hard to move the camera tilt.All the best for nowArmand",,,,,,Eric_Stackpole,"Hey Armand!It's awesome to see the ROV coming along so well!  Here is a GIF I made recently of a 2.6 E-Chassis which may be helpful for figuring out how to organize everything.

Worked fairly well once I figured out the correct IP address and port to use in Putty: <span>192.168.254.1:3131</span> The address is fair enough, but the port required some searching.Then enabling the ""1"" in the correct places went fine. Had some trouble exiting and saving the session until I realised I had to press escape to leave edit mode. Was then able to save using the ""wq""Once I had loaded the updated software into the Arduino, OROV booted and came up with compass and depth data among others. Turned out that the little chip inside the epoxy is not 100% aligned with bottom of acrylbase, so it shows a tilt of 6 degrees when flat on table. I guess I need to remove the IMU module and glue it back on with a counteroffset to get it straight.Calibrated depth in cockpit, still shows about -0.3 meter  at surface. I guess I can live with that. The compass calibration I'm not quite sure how to perform. I have done similar calibration on my diving computer with built in compass, that is done by rotating the compass 360 degrees. Currently the compass does not appear to show correct heading, but is updating when turning the ROV.  With regards to organizing the interior of the electronics module, the problem is partly my own fault, I added a total of 10 wires in spare, so the 25 pin is full. That cramps up the space a bit.Have bent each wire individually 90 degrees and tried to spread it out more as a flat cable versus a round cable bundle as it originally was. Have also cut the USB cable for the camera and re-soldered it without the excessive cable. Hopefully this will help up with the ""claustrophobia"" inside the tube. ",,,,,,Tobias_Ehn,"Hi Armand,i would not try to remove an glue the sensor again. There must be another opportunity to set the offset. I guess if you remove it you'll destroy it.I am missing some kind of guide how to calibrate the sensor to. I once pressed the button zero depth and calibrate compass and it seemed as if some calibration was done. Watching at some static html code on the ROV i could see, that the buttons are not linked to something. I am not really sure but i think they do not work at the moment.to sum up,my sensor is not showing the right heading at the momentif i turn it 90Â° it shows the correct heading seen from the point it was before.i dont know how to tell the sensor where north is.Maybe the experts can help :-)",,,,,,Armand_Svendsen,"Hi Tobias,I might have explained myself a bit inaccurate. The plan is not to try to remove the card from inside the epoxy and reglue it. I was more thinking of tilting the hole IMU module a bit to the side compared to the ROV chassis to compensate for the offset.You may be right about the sensor calibration, it says -0.3 meters whether it is calibrated or not, so the calibration may not do anything at all.But at least the data is coming in, eventually I'm sure someone more fluent in programming than me will look into the matter.",,,,,,Armand_Svendsen,"<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3295/02aa7469a83676ae.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/111569116451ef13acd1e252757f6958dadd167b"" title=""359-2014021220.34.43.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""640"" height=""480""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">359-2014021220.34.43.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">3264x2448 2.4 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><br><div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3296/d8c6a4227475344f.jpg"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/0229f6a40e958e1c6875162a62eed85f44888382"" title=""361-2014021315.07.53.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noopener""><img  width=""640"" height=""480""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">361-2014021315.07.53.jpg</span><span class=""informations"">3264x2448 2.22 MB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><br>Ok, so far so good, received the Hysol E-90FL in the mail thanks to Kjetil, who's relatives has been a trip to the US. Potted the endcaps and battery tubes. I also sealed one of the vent holes on one of the end caps, I don't see the point in having two, one should be sufficient.I also added fuses to the battery power leads, since I experienced that one of them broke off the soldering point on the 25 pin connector. Worst case, short circuiting LiPo batteries could be nasty with fire as a result.Well, the E-90FL has now cured, and I have done a water test in my bath tub. Worked great, needs some adjusting of ballast, but that's details.Video of the ordeal can be watched here: <a href=""http://youtu.be/EFqttUZvzBQ"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://youtu.be/EFqttUZvzBQ</a>Testing in a real life environment will follow :-)",,,,,,Tobias_Ehn,"Hi Armand,did you use the software image 2.5-05? I am always wondering, why me cockpit looks different. The lights brightnessbar is in the very top whereas mine ist still in the sidebar.Plus the picture is filling the whole freespace. Everything looks cleaner and more usable.Great work so far.I stuck at the potting part with my build, because i cant get Hysol 90 - and its hard to find alternatives. And i only have one try i think. ;-)Tobias",,,,,,Tobias_Ehn,The stress test was nice!!:-),,,,,,Armand_Svendsen,"Hi Tobias,Yes, the stress test was a nice touch, although not quite planned for :-)Software, good question, I used the version that came preloaded in the 2.6 kit which ever that is they ship it with. Have not looked into it yet. Received the kit early February, so presumably it is the latest version from github: <a href=""https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-image/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">https://github.com/OpenROV/openrov-image/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md</a>See that the latest image is dated 26/28-11-2013, so I guess this is the one  I use. Or is there a way to see the revision no in the cockpit? Have not really looked.Hysol 90: The European Equivalent apparently is Loctite 9489, but that also appears to be a Holy Grail amongst the epoxy alchemists, at least not easy to come by in Norway. I'm sure there are other stuff that will do the trick, but to be the first one to try it is a leap of faith.Another issue: IMU. As described earlier I connected the IMU/Depth module as per procedure, updated the config file in Putt and uploaded it into the Arduino. After that it worked great once I changed the position of the module, except for the compass data, which was far off by approx. 80 degrees, but was updating. The OROV cockpit gave me associations to flying a F-16 for a moment as I watched the screen flicker with artificial horizons and banking indications as I performed break dance with my Rover.Next day as I wandered into my little workshop with a cup of coffe and thinking happy thoughts, I  cranked up the  Rover, suddenly all IMU data was dead as a dudu. All that remains is the depth and temperature data, which still ticks along. I had not done anything to it, it worked like a charm the day before, but now suddenly the IMU part is dead, the cockpit is showing 0 for value for all pitch, yaw, roll and whatever. I tried to upload the Arduino again, but the same disappointing result. If it had been a wiring problem, I would suspect the depth values to be dead as well since it is communicating on a I2C bus. That leaves me with 2 alternatives as far as I can see, either the IMU circuitry on the board has gone to Silicon heaven, or there is something dodgy in the software department. If anyone else has experienced something similar, or have some cunning ideas, feel free to share them here."YouTube sound on assembly of 2.6,https://forum.openrov.com/t/youtube-sound-on-assembly-of-2-6/801,OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8,659,Feb '14,1,YouTube sound on assembly of 2.6 - OpenROV 2.5 - 2.8 - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dave_Hinton,I donâ€™t seem to get any sound on the YouTube assembly instructions for Openrov 2.6.

Generally, the kv rating describes how many RPM the motor will spin per volt.  For an 800kv motor running at 12 volts the the theoretical speed would be 800*12 = 9600RPM.For OpenROV, (or any underwater vehicle using brushless motors) one would want the lowest kv rating possible since in water you need more torque and less speed, and lower kv values use energy more in that favor.  800kv was the best we could find in a low cost, easy to mount, readily available package.",,,,,,Al_Cast,"Yeah Eric, at first I thought it was a typo.Later I went to the hobby king site and found that they are using German Electrical nomenclature such, as you stated, RPM/V.  In the US we do not use such thing. We simply say RPM at Rated VFor a long time I have been wanting to manufacture an enclosed, waterproof, BLDC motor in an aluminum or SS case. (for more advance ROVs)  One model would even have a Gearbox to torque down from higher RPM.   Yet another with a Gearbox and an Archimedial screw, not more than 3 spirals long in a tight fitting conduit for Positive displacement.I do have a machine shop and I am retrofitting a CNC lathe.  I have already finished retrofitting a CNC Bridgeport Mill.   This of course would be for taking the ROV units to a higher level.

Building tasks can be broken down into seven general assembly sections:<br><br>(1) Cutting out parts(2) Heat bending the outer shell(3) Assembling and gluing the inner structure(4) Assembling and gluing the end caps(5) Assembling the battery packs,(6) Assembling and waterproofing the thrusters(7) Potting the wire pass throughs in the end caps.Â Assembly of the entire OpenROV 2.3 structure can be done over a weekend, and most sections take less then an hour. Listed with each assembly section is a Bill Of Materials (what parts and tools you'll need), general notes for the assembly (what the best working space is, how long it should take, what each part is for, etc), the instruction set itself, and notes on what to do if something goes wrong.Â  We hope that improvements will be made periodically by builders who find tricks and rules of thumb to make the build go more smoothly.Â <br><br>Remember, if you have questions, you can always visit the OpenROV builder's forum at this link<br><br><a href=""http://openrov.com/forum/categories/builder-s-forum/listForCategory"">Builder's Forum</a><br><br>Good luck, and happy building!Â Â Â Â <br>**************************<strong>1. Cutting Out Parts</strong>**********************<br><br><span>Items needed:</span><br><br>Materials/ Parts<em>Note: although the OpenROV 2.3 design is metric, most stores in the US will only sell acrylic in English units, so we've provided dimensions in inches for this section.</em><br>Tools<br><span>Assembly Notes:</span>Each OpenROV has a unique serial number.Â  If you plan to laser cut your own OpenROV structure, please request a serial number by sending an email with the subject heading ""SERIAL REQUEST"" to openrov@gmail.com several days before you plan to cut.Â  Once we get your request, we will issue a serial number which will be valid for the next three days.Â  If you don't cut during that time, just let us know and we can reissue you a new number.<br><span>Procedure:</span>1. Remove backing from one side of 24"" by 18"" acrylic sheet and place on laser cutter platform with backing-less side facing up<br>2. Focus laser to top surface of sheet<br>3. Cut out test piece (such ) in upper left hand corner and verify quality<br>4. At high speed, verify that laser path stays on sheet by running with pointer on and laser off (lid open)<br>5. Cut outÂ <a>Laser Cut Pattern</a><br>6. Inspect all pieces for quality.Â  Whipe clean rastered area with moist rag7. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for 24"" x 12"" sheet, but for <a>Endcap</a> pattern8. Wrap masking tape around acrylic tube so that it's center is about 175mm from one end.Â  Masking tape will hold a mark and also prevent chipping during the cut<br>9. Mark the masking tape at exactly 175mm from the end of the acrylic tube<br>10. Use a chop saw to (slowly) cut the acrylic tube at the mark<br>11.

Heat Bending Outer Shell******************<br><span>Items needed:</span>Â Materials/ PartsÂ Tools<span>:<br></span>Â <span>Procedure:</span><br>1. Begin heating the strip heater.Â  For the Formech FLB500, a setting of ""5"" on the heat dial is desired, and should take about 15 minuets to reach full temperature from startup.<br><br>2. Prepair a bending guide that will be able to hold the heated acrylic so that it is bent at just less then 90 degrees (perhaps around 87 degreees).<br><br>3. Using a razor, etch lines in two places along the length of the shell on the opposite side of the logo (which will eventually be the inside of the shell) as shown.Â  A carpender's square can be used to etch the lines at right angles to the forward and aft edges of the shell.Â  These lines will be used to assure the piece is being bent in precisly the right spot.Â <div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3438/c042a5f171d02f67.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/21473482492d97f60c4eaedf35b3606e6f44b956"" title=""27-Bendinglineetches.png""><img  width=""640"" height=""461""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">27-Bendinglineetches.png</span><span class=""informations"">734x491 16.1 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><br><br>4. Remove any additional backing on the shell<br><br>5. Make a note of the minuet and second, and place the shell -logo down- onto the heat bender so that one of the etched lines is aligned with the heating element strip heater.Â  The shell should be in roughly the center of the heating area.<br><br>6. After 2 minuets has elapst, varify that the plastic is easely bendable over the heating element and carefully lift the shell off the heater from one end.Â  If the shell is not yet flexable, ad time as needed until flexability is achieved.Â  Make note of how long this takes so that the same timeing can be used for the other bend.<br><br>7. Immediately after removing the shell from the strip heater, bend it by hand along the etched line (with the line on the inside of the bend), being vary cairful to assure the etched line is co-linear with and in the center of the bend<br><br>8. Place the shell on the already prepaired jig and hold until cool (no longer flexable)<br><br>9. Repeat steps 3-8 for the other bend line.Â  Be sure to place the shell on the strip heater for the same amount of time as the previous bend or bend radii may be different.Â Â Â ****************(3) Assembling and gluing the inner structure****************<span>Items Needed:</span>Materials/ Parts:<br>Tools:<br><span>Assembly Notes:</span>Â <br><span>Procedure</span>:At this point, description of each step would just be silly, so instead, assembly instructions are shown below Lego-style.Â  Brief written instructions may be added later to help with procedures that are not intuitive- if you have any questions about the assembly, please feel free to list them in the Comments section of this page, and we'll try to address them in this instruction set.<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3439/b2fce0926d7ea169.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/672449347c0fee779c2f64a957ed45a1eb3d591f"" title=""29-OpenROV2.3AssemblyInstructionSet.png""><img  width=""690"" height=""500""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">29-OpenROV2.3AssemblyInstructionSet.png</span><span class=""informations"">1280x10000 421 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><br>",,,,,,David_Lang,"<div class=""lightbox-wrapper""><a class=""lightbox"" href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/3437/81c5831039d62b15.png"" data-download-href=""https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business6/uploads/openrov/925995e3ff4fa584422c80f891ef575a82afc3ce"" title=""25-OpenROVLaserCut.png""><img  width=""640"" height=""419""><div class=""meta""><span class=""filename"">25-OpenROVLaserCut.png</span><span class=""informations"">898x546 676 KB</span><span class=""expand""></span></div></a></div><br>",,,,,,iderryan,"So... what about the rest of the build?

You said you haven't glued the structure into the housing (aka shell) yet.. Don't do that- there's no need!  We should make it more clear in the instructions, but the internal structure is meant to clip into the shell mechanically and be held in place when you screw the cross bars down. This way you can take the internal housing out the get better access to the parts later on.  Make sense?Eric",,,,,,Marius_Antares,I think I am working on version 2.3 and my parts seem to be missing the long thin rectangular piece (fettucine shaped).  Has this spacer been omitted from this version?,,,,,,David_Lang,The long thin piece is in the cut file for 2.3. It's rather inconspicuous do you may have tossed it with the scraps.,,,,,,Marius_Antares,"It appears the vertical spacer is not on this version...instead it has two horizontal spacers that look like the number ""1"" that serve the same purpose...at least this is what intuition is telling us as there is no other place for these pieces to really fit...If I am correct these pieces reinforce and widen these tabs for insertion into the housing/shell (got it)."Difference of structure designs,https://forum.openrov.com/t/difference-of-structure-designs/180,OpenROV 2.4 and Below,769,Oct '12,1,Difference of structure designs - OpenROV 2.4 and Below - OpenROV Forums,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Robert_Angermayr,"Hi,im going to laser the structure parts and i'm a bit confused about the files in git/development.There is a file calledOpenROV_Dev_Laser_Vector_Blue (Compact).dxt which is 4 days old (no version) from Ericand another fileOpenROV_Dev_Laser_Vector_Blue.dxt which is 3 months old (version 2.3.2) from Eric too.what is the difference between those versions and which one should i choose.RegardsRob",,,,,,David_Lang,"Use the compact. It has the new e-chasis design for inside the electronics tube. <br><br>I called it compact because our acrylic supplier gave us 18"" x 23 1/2"" sheets, so we had to shrink everything down.Sorry for the confusion. I'll get that cleared up."
